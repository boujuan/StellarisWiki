# Unique buildings

Unique buildings can only be built a limited number of times. These limits fall within two main categories:

- **Planet-limited** buildings, which typically have a limit of 1 per planet.
- **Empire-limited** buildings, which typically have a limit of 1 per empire.

Many of these buildings require the capital to have reached a certain level. Unless otherwise stated, all buildings on this page can be constructed only once per planet.

## Common planet unique buildings

These buildings, or some variation of them, are available to most empires regardless of their civics, origin, or ascension path.

### Gaia Seeder buildings

Gaia Seeders can only be constructed by empires with an Idyllic Bloom civic, and can only be built on terraformable natural planets .

Building and upgrading Gaia Seeders takes Time 480 days for each phase. Phase 1 requires a Tier II capital or above. Upgrading it to Phase 2 or above depends on planet type and available terraforming technology:

- With no terraforming technology, the planet class must match the primary species' planet class preference . Upkeep on such worlds is not increased.
- With Terrestrial Sculpting technology, the planet needs to match the climate type of the primary species' planet class preference. Upkeep on such worlds is increased by +25% .
- With Ecological Adaptation technology, the planet can be of any class except Tomb World. Upkeep on such worlds is increased by +50% .
- With Climate Restoration technology, the planet can be a Tomb World as well. Upkeep on such worlds is increased by +75% . (even with Tomb World Preference)

Empires whose primary species has a special habitability trait (such as Gaia World Preference) do not recognize any regular planet as matching their climate preference. If the habitability trait is the Mutagenic Habitability trait, they can build Gaia Seeders on any natural planet class, including Tomb Worlds, but are still subject to all applicable upkeep modifiers.

The Final Phase building remains on Gaia Worlds, and boosts Bloomed and Budding traits. On Gaia World without a Gaia Seeder building, the Final Phase building can be built without the need to go through earlier phases.

### Knightly Order buildings
