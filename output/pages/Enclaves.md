# Enclaves

**Enclaves** are special AI empires. They do not own any planets or systems, but consist of large stations. Once an empire has made contact with an enclave, they can purchase various services from the enclave. Enclaves are listed in the Diplomacy Menu under the "Others" category. Each enclave has two or three basic interactions, and a number of restricted interactions that can only be used after sufficient opinion is reached.

The maximum opinion with an enclave is 100, and an empire builds opinion with them by using their services or owning the system with the enclave. Enclaves in owned systems gain +1 opinion with the system owner each year. This is not cumulative when owning multiple systems with the same enclave.

When an enclave modifier expires, the empire will be offered the option to extend it.

## Curator Order

The Curator Order is an enclave dedicated to safeguarding lost knowledge and spread across up to three stations. They offer the following services:

| Service | Effect | Cost | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Research | +5% Research speed for 10 years, and +20 opinion | 500 + 5 per empire size | |
| Mysteries of the Universe Tell us about | Adds a Leviathan point of interest to the situation log, and +10 opinion | 300 | Yes Encountered a Guardian |

| Mysteries of the Universe How would we fare | Compares the total fleet power against the<br>Guardian<br>(note that the advice is wrong on higher difficulties)<br>- 0-30k: Poorly. Very poorly. Wait a second, you're not actually thinking of...? My goodness, with the ships you have? It... it would be a slaughter!<br>- 30-60k: I would strongly advise against it. Your attacks would likely be more of an annoyance than a threat.<br>- 60-120k: Hmmm... yes... yes, I suppose you might actually stand a chance. If you combined your entire fleet... it would not be an easy victory, mind you, but one that is at least within the realm of possibility.<br>- 120k+: Yours is a mighty fleet, comparable to some of the greatest armadas recorded in the annals of the Curator Order. Victory is certainly within your reach. | 1000 | Yes Encountered a Guardian |

### Assist with collection

Any empire that constructs a Grand Archive megastructure will gain +10 Opinion with the Curator Order and will unlock the option to ask them for assistance with the collection. The options available depend on on how many exhibit slots from a certain specimen category the empire unlocked. The bonuses and buildings cost 1000 Energy to purchase while the relics cost 5000 Energy to purchase. Only one reward from each level can be purchased. The relics offered are decided when the option is first chosen so asking again will not change the offer.

| | 3 Exhibits | 5 Exhibits | 9 Exhibits |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aesthetic Wonders | Choose one of two permanent bonuses:<br>- +10% Monthly Unity<br>- +100% Specimen Selling Cost | Unlocks the Holo-Museum of Wonders building | Choose one of two relics:<br>- Celestial Resonator<br>- Gavel of the Tribunal<br>- The Pattern Maker<br>- Tyianki Matriarch Nerve Core<br>- Vaporous Mega-Orchid |

## Shroudwalkers

The Shroudwalker Enclave is an enclave dedicated to harnessing the power of the Shroud and spread across up to three stations. The systems with these stations will be connected via Shroud Tunnels. On larger galaxies, one of the systems might be protected by a Psionic Avatar. Empires with the Teachers of the Shroud origin will start in contact with the Shroudwalker Enclave.

If either an endgame crisis takes place or an empire with the Galactic Nemesis ascension perk reaches crisis level 5, the enclave will disappear. Empires with the Teachers of the Shroud origin will receive 50 Zro and a choice between +10% monthly Influence or Unity for 20 years.

The Shroudwalkers are in opposition with the Mindwardens and will refuse to communicate with empires that have 100 Opinion with Mindwardens enclave or have the Mindwardens origin. Each time an empire gains Opinion with Mindwardens, it will lose an equal amount with Shroudwalkers. Constructing a Shroud Seal for the first time will also reduce the Opinion of Shroudwalkers by −5 .

The Shroudwalker Enclave offers the following services:

| Service | Effect | Cost | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fate** | Starts a Sign of the Visitor or Sign of the Locus situation, which can trigger various events or create anomalies, and +10 opinion Cost is increased by 40% before the mid-game start year and reduced by 30% after the end-game start year | 50 500 per 1000 pops (max 9000) | |

| **Travel** | Allow the construction of a Shroud Beacon starbase building, and +10 opinion | 800 | 40 Opinion Can only be done once |
| **Astral Rift** | Creates an Astral Rift in a random owned system without an adjacent Astral Rift, and +30 opinion | 50 500 | Shadows of the Shroud DLC Astral Planes DLC Rift Sphere technology 50 Opinion Can only be done once |

Empires with the Shroud-Forged origin that complete the Forged by the Shroud situation by supporting the Shroud will uncover a system with a wormhole that leads to a system with one of the Shroudwalker enclave stations.

## Mercenary enclaves

Unlike other enclaves, mercenary enclaves do not exist at the start of the game and instead are founded during gameplay. Gestalt Consciousness empires cannot found mercenary enclaves unless they have the Tactical Algorithms civic, but they can become patrons by taking ownership of an enclave's system. Fanatic Purifiers and Mindwardens empires cannot found mercenary enclaves.

Founding a mercenary enclave requires sufficient mercenary enclave capacity , a fleet of size 50 or larger that cannot cloak led by a Commander in an owned system with a moon or asteroid, and no other enclave already present in that system. Founding a mercenary enclave costs 100 Influence, 2000 Alloys, and either 1500 Energy if the empire uses a mechanical shipset or 1500 Food if the empire uses a biological shipset. Fleets containing space fauna cannot found an enclave. Once the order is given, the enclave constructs its station in the fleet's current system, the fleet's commander leaves the empire to become the leader of the new enclave, and the fleet is transferred to the enclave. The enclave will start with 30 Opinion towards its patron.

Mercenary enclaves provide the following services:

1. Empires can rent a mercenary fleet for 10 years and gain +15 opinion for an Energy cost that scales with the enclave's opinion and tier. The contract can be renewed at any point for an additional energy cost and +5 opinion. Mercenary fleets are led by Commanders with the Mercenary Warrior trait. If the mercenary enclave station is attacked, all mercenary fleets are recalled, and their clients are refunded between 3000-44000 energy, depending on enclave tier.
2. Empires that have at least 20 opinion with the enclave can pay 600, 1100, or 2000 energy to hire 5, 10 or 15 mercenary armies. If the enclave is at least tier 4, empires can also pay 1200 or 2300 energy to hire 5 or 10 mercenary mechanized armies. All options will grant opinion equal to the number of armies hired, plus 5 additional opinion if hiring a mechanized army.
3. Empires that have at least 30 opinion with the enclave can buy +15% naval capacity for 10 years. This costs between 1000 and 5000 energy based on current capacity and gives +15 opinion.
4. Empires that have at least 40 opinion with the enclave can pay 1000 energy to unlock the Mercenary Garrison starbase building and gain +15 opinion.
5. Empires that have at least 50 opinion with the enclave can pay 1500 or 5000 energy to gain +15% damage versus a mid-game or end-game crisis.

## Mindwardens

The Mindwarden Enclave is an enclave dedicated to fighting against species with the Psionic or Latent Psionic traits and such species will not be able to interact with the enclave. Their system contains a Shroud Seal megastructure. If an empire with the Mindwardens origin exists, the enclave will not be created at the start of the game but can be created by the empire with the origin 2 years after they defeat the starting psionic empire. If the enclave was created at galaxy generation, it will will use the Mindwarden shipset. If it was created by an empire, it will use the same shipset as the empire.

The Mindwardens are in opposition with the Shroudwalkers and will refuse to communicate with empires that have 100 Opinion with Shroudwalkers enclave. Each time an empire gains Opinion with Shroudwalkers, it will lose an equal amount with Mindwardens.

The Mindwardens will contact any empire that encounters a Psionic Aura and their founder species does not have the Psionic or Latent Psionic traits.

If the Mindwardens were created at the start of the game and are destroyed, they will respawn in 10 years in a random unowned system. If they are destroyed a second time, they will not respawn.

The Mindwardens Enclave offer the following services:

| Service | Effect | Cost | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Psionic Target** | - Creates a fleet to attack a system of the targeted empire for a year unless destroyed<br>- Can target empires whose founder species has the Psionic or Latent Psionic trait and cannot target the Holy Guardians fallen empire<br>- If the enclave wins, it creates a Shroud Seal in the attacked system<br>- Gives +30 Opinion with the enclave but reduces it by −30 with the Shroudwalkers<br>- Size of the fleet depends on how many years have passed since the start of the game<br>0-39 40-59 60-79 80+ 3 Corvettes 3 Frigates 2 Destroyers 4 Cruisers 4 Corvettes 2 Frigates 2 Destroyers 5 Cruisers 2 Battleships 6 Corvettes 6 Frigates 4 Destroyers 3 Cruisers 2 Battleships 1 Titan 6 Corvettes 6 Frigates 8 Destroyers 6 Cruisers 4 Battleships 1 Titan | 0-39 | 40-59 |

## Attacking enclaves

While enclaves never become hostile to any empire except in retaliation, they can be attacked like any neutral entity. With around 16k fleet power and highest level weapons they are no easy prey but various rewards can be salvaged from their remnants, depending on the type of enclave destroyed. If an enclave is attacked it will cancel all ongoing deals with the attacking empire and if the enclave is destroyed it will cancel all ongoing deals with all empires.

Enclave stations do not drop debris for salvage. Attacking a Curator, Artisan, or Shroudwalker enclave makes every enclave station of the same type unavailable for trade. Destroying an enclave station for the first time awards the Return to Dust achievement.

## Founding enclaves

Empires that do not have the Mindwardens origin can found mercenary enclaves while empires that have the origin and defeated the empire in the cluster behind their home system will unlock in two years the option to found a mindwarden enclave. Founding an enclave requires sufficient Enclave Capacity and a fleet of sufficient size that cannot cloak and is led by a Commander in an owned system with no other enclave present. Founding an enclave costs 100 Influence, 2000 Alloys, and either 1500 Energy if the empire uses a Mechanical shipset or 1500 Food if the empire uses a Biological shipset. Fleets containing space fauna cannot found an enclave. Once the order is given, the enclave constructs its station in the fleet's current system, the fleet's Commander leaves the empire to become the leader of the new enclave, and the fleet is transferred to the enclave.

- Mercenary enclaves require a fleet of size 50 or more and the system must contain a moon or asteroid. The enclave will start with 30 Opinion.
- Mindwarden enclaves require a fleet of size 30 or more. The enclave will start with 100 Opinion. After founding an enclave the empire can offer every year to pay 1000 Energy to the enclave to increase their capacity by 1.

Enclaves founded by empires build and upgrade ships the same way playable empires do, using all technologies researched by the empire that founded the enclave at the time of the founding. The enclave's patron can grant the enclave all its researched technologies and gain +1000 Energy and +15 Opinion.

The empire that owns an enclave's system, initially its founder, is the enclave's patron. Patrons have slightly reduced prices and receive a dividend at regular intervals. The dividend interval is mechanically a situation , and the base progress rate is +0.417 per month, resulting in a total time of **20** years . With all positive modifiers maxed out, the interval is a mere **1.83** years , though that relies on a non-patron hiring the fleet. More consistently, with the patron hiring the fleet, the minimum interval is **2.25** years . The rate is increased (and thus total interval decreased) by the following:

| Source | Base multiple | Raw increase | Interval with only this modifier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lord of War ascension perk | +2.5 | +1.043 | 5.75 years |
| Enclave fleet hired by anyone | +1 | +0.417 | 10 years |
| Enclave fleet hired by non-patron (stacks with above) | +2 | +0.833 | 5 years |
| Per mercenary enclave tier | +0.4 (max +2 ) | +0.167 (max +0.835 ) | See table below |
| Per Defensive Privatization resolution level | +0.5 (max +2.5 ) | +0.208 (max +1.04 ) | 13.3 years at level 1 5.75 years at level 5 |
| Enclave has Financial Troubles modifier | −5 | −2.085 | Never Cannot reduce progress below **3** |

The dividend can be in the form of basic resources or research; there is also a small chance of a special dividend or no dividend.

| Dividend type | Chance | Tier 0/1 | Tier 2/3 | Tier 4/5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Basic Resources | **32%** | - 6x energy output ( 100~1000 )<br>- 6x food output ( 100~1000 )<br>- 12x minerals output ( 150~2000 ) | - 12x energy output ( 150~2000 )<br>- 12x food output ( 150~2000 )<br>- 18x minerals output ( 250~5000 ) | - 18x energy output ( 250~5000 )<br>- 18x food output ( 250~5000 )<br>- 24x minerals output ( 350~10 000 ) |
| Energy only | **32%** | 12x energy output ( 150~2000 ) | 18x energy output ( 250~5000 ) | 24x energy output ( 350~10 000 ) |
| Research | **32%** | - 6x energy output ( 100~1000 )<br>- 6x research output ( 100~1000 of each) | - 12x energy output ( 150~2000 )<br>- 12x research output ( 150~2000 of each) | - 18x energy output ( 250~5000 )<br>- 18x research output ( 250~5000 of each) |
| Special | **2%** | - 6x energy output ( 100~1000 )<br>- 6x minerals output ( 100~1000 ) | - 12x energy output ( 150~2000 )<br>- 12x minerals output ( 150~2000 )<br>- 12x research output ( 250~100 000 of each) | - 18x energy output ( 250~5000 )<br>- 18x minerals output ( 250~5000 )<br>- 18x research output ( 350~100 000 of each) |
| Financial Troubles Choose one of three options: | **2%** | **•** 6x energy output ( 100~1000 ), and enclave gains Financial Troubles modifier for 10 years **•** Kills current enclave ruler, and enclave gains Financial Troubles modifier for 2.78 years **•** Subsidize enclave, based on tier (below), and gain +20 opinion | | |
| - −1000 Energy<br>- +50 Influence | - −2500 Energy<br>- +75 Influence | - −10000 Energy<br>- +100 Influence | | |

The patron can also offer to upgrade the enclave – with a one year cooldown, up to 5 times; upgrading improves the tier of its weapons and grants +20 Opinion. But for mercenary enclaves it also increases the fleet recall costs.

| Enclave tier | Upgrade cost | | Fleet recall cost | | Base patron dividend time | Enclave loadout | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mechanical | Biological | Energy | Influence | | | | | | | | | |
| 0 | - | - | 1500 | 50 | 20 years | 0 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 500 1000 | 500 1000 | 3000 | 75 | 14.3 years | 0 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 |

## Crystalline empire

If playing with the Void Dwellers origin (AI empires can't trigger it), then there is a 1% chance that during the mid-game, a unique enclave known as the Crystalline Empire spawns near the galactic core. Its system does not have hyperlane connections but instead has a wormhole to a random system in the galaxy. Empires that are not Genocidal and have not attacked them can offer to help them every 20 years to receive one of the following:

- 1 use of the Settle Crystalline Refugees decision on a Habitat for 10 years pops)
- 1 use of the Crystalline Construction decision on a Habitat for 10 years
- A level 7 scientist

Destroying the Crystalline Empire enclave grants no rewards.
