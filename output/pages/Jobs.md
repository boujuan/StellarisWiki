# Jobs

A Job is where resources are produced on worlds. Jobs are divided into different strata and higher stratum jobs are usually filled before lower stratum ones. Most Jobs are created by Districts and Buildings and thus limited in number. Depending on its origin an empire will use one of two job systems:

- Jobs in empires that do not have the Wilderness origin are worked by pops and receive efficiency bonuses and penalties depending on the traits of the pop working the job. Pops automatically fill empty jobs that they are capable of holding and generally choose the highest stratum job that gets the most out of their traits based on a weighting system; however, a priority can be set towards and away from specific jobs to ensure they are filled before others. New pops that are more suitable for a job than the current pop holding the job may take the job from it. Each job has a slider that can be lowered to decrease the maximum number of pops that can have the job.
- Jobs in empires that have the Wilderness origin are worked without pops and receive efficiency bonuses and penalties depending on the traits of the primary species. Each job has a slider that can be lowered to decrease the resource consumption and production of the job.

## Job categories

Most jobs belong to a job category that is mentioned on certain tooltips, and groups it together with other similar jobs. This allows modifiers to apply to multiple job types.

For instance, Alloy Mega-Forges increasing output and upkeep by +1 Alloys and −1 Minerals from Metallurgists will also provide additional output and upkeep to Odd Factory Workers.

All sub-categories will always inherit multiplicative modifiers from their parent category, but only a few specified sub-categories also inherit additive modifiers.
