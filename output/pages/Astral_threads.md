# Astral threads

**Astral threads** are filaments of condensed space-time and the result of dimensional planes colliding with one another. They can only be found on Astral Scar celestial objects or by completing astral rifts .

Empires can initially store up to 500 astral threads. Each completed astral rift increases the storage capacity by 250 and each Astral Siphon building increases it by 100 per tier.

## Astral actions

Astral threads are mainly used for astral actions , which give the empire an instant benefit. Most astral actions requires the completion of a number of astral rifts before they are unlocked. Actions are either limited-use which typically unlock a mechanic permanently, or repeatable with a single-use or timed benefit per activation of the action. A number of actions increase in cost with each use, up to a maximum cost.

| Action | Rifts | Cost | Cooldown | Effect | Additional requirements |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gain Physics Insight** Allow our scientists to requisition Astral Threads to further our understanding of physics. | 0 | 250-1750 | Time 1800 days | - +10% Monthly Physics Research for 5 years<br>- Cost increases by 50 with each use | |
| **Astral Splitting** By weaving extra Astral Threads into the delicate fabric of space, we should be able to create an artificial tear in reality. Doing this too often would put the galaxy in danger of unravelling entirely. | 0 | 300-1200 | Time 3600 days | - Creates an astral rift in a random owned system without adjacent astral rifts<br>- Cost increases by 300 with each use | - **Rift Sphere** technology<br>- Can be used up to 4 times |
| **Astral Boost** Augment our ships' engines with Astral Threads, improving their maneuverability. | 1 | 500-1000 | Time 1800 days | - +15% Sublight Speed for 5 years<br>- Time −15% Hyper Jump Charge Time for 5 years<br>- Cost increases by 50 with each use | |
| **Astral Siphon** There is a way to unravel the fabric between space and time. By constructing carefully calibrated extraction devices, we can produce a steady amount of Astral Threads. | 1 | 700-900 | Time 3600 days | - Permanently unlocks the Astral Siphon building or its next upgrade tier<br>- Cost increases by 100 with each use | Can be used up to 3 times |
| **Flash Forge Hyper Relay** Hyperlanes already possess interesting quantum properties, but by interweaving a given amount of astral thread, we achieved fantastic results. By breaking through to other dimensions, we can now access Hyper Relays that already exist (or will exist in the future). We are nearly certain that we are the only ones 'borrowing' them in this manner. | 3 | 500-1000 50 | Time 900 days | - Next Hyper Relay is constructed instantly and free<br>- Cost increases by 50 with each use | - Overlord DLC<br>- **Hyper Relays** technology |
| **Dimensional Lock** By attuning our ships to the unique quantum signatures of a fold in space, we can align its frequencies with our own. However, such an attunement is not permanent. Eventually, the breach will gravitate back toward its natural inclination. | 3 | 1000 | Time 3600 days | - Allows science ships to lock a single owned bypass<br>- Time Lock lasts for 10 years | **Wormhole Stabilization** technology |
| **Lateral Artifacting** We can manipulate the flow of time to make use of two powerful artifacts at once. | 4 | 1000-2000 | Time 3600 days | - Allows activation of second relic triumph<br>- Cost scales by length of remaining triumph and cooldown<br>- Base cost increases by 100 with each use | Yes At least 2 relics |
| **Summon Dimensional Fleet** Our attunement to the astral planes has deepened. We are now able to call upon extradimensional warriors to support us in our cause. From where they come, or why they come, we cannot be sure. | 5 | 1750 | Time 1800 days | - Controllable Extradimensional fleet for 10 years<br>- 2 Destroyers and Cruisers per explored Astral Rift | **Psionic Theory** technology |

### Astral unlocks

Astral unlocks are astral actions that can only be used once and permanently unlock a technology or feature.

| Action | Rifts | Cost | Unlocks | Additional requirements |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gain Quantum Catapult Insight** The unique properties of Astral Threads should allow us to further break the bounds of FTL travel. | 2 | 750 | **Quantum Catapult** technology with 25% progress | - Overlord DLC<br>- No **Quantum Catapult** technology |
| **Astral Calibration** By harnessing the capabilities of Astral Threads even further, we should be able to increase the precision of our Quantum Catapult. | 2 | 1500 | - Astral Calibration empire modifier:<br>  - Tracking +25% Quantum Catapult Accuracy<br>  - +15% Quantum Ambush Ship Fire Rate<br>  - Time +100% Quantum Ambush Duration | - Overlord DLC<br>- **Quantum Catapult** technology<br>- Quantum Catapult megastructure |
| **Gain Hyper Relay Insight** The unique properties of Astral Threads should help us better understand how to fold space on itself. | 3 | 300 | **Hyper Relays** technology with 50% progress | - Overlord DLC<br>- Hyperlane Breach Points technology<br>- No **Hyper Relays** technology |
| **Folding Hyperspace** With some clever manipulation of the plane between dimensions, we can fold space along itself to achieve some impressive results. | 3 | 1000 | Astral Jump fleet order | - Either:<br>  - **Jump Drive** technology<br>  - **Psi Jump Drives** technology<br>  - **Subspace Drive** technology |
| **Dimensional Shifting** With some clever manipulation of the fabric between this dimension and another, we can fold it along itself to achieve some impressive results. | 4 | 1000 | Phase Fleet fleet order | |
| **Planar Mastery** Our journeys into the Astral Planes have helped us better understand the fabric that binds the universes. We can weave these threads in ways few others comprehend. | 5 | 1500 | Astral edicts | |
