# Traditions

Traditions represent the socio-cultural evolution of an empire as it expands and develops and consist of abilities, edicts, or bonuses unlocked with the unity resource. Traditions are a key mechanic for tailoring the playstyle of an empire by allowing the player to reinforce the empire's strengths or lessen its weaknesses. Completing a tradition tree unlocks a slot for an ascension perk, which provides even further enhancements.

## Tradition cost

The cost of unlocking a tradition depends on how many traditions the empire has already unlocked, as well as the empire size cost. The tradition cost formula is the following:

tradition cost = [300 + (8 * num traditions)^(1.8)] * [1 + (empire size - 100) * 0.002 * (1 - empire size effect)] * tradition cost

"Tradition cost" refers to the game setting . "Empire size effect" is a modifier to the effect of empire size on its associated penalties, including tradition cost; it is affected by certain authorities. The adoption and finisher effects both count as traditions in their own right, so starting a group counts as one tradition, and unlocking the last tradition in a group counts as two.

## Tradition trees

Traditions are grouped into tradition trees with 5 traditions each, as well as a bonus for adopting the tradition tree and one for finishing it. Each empire can select up to 7 tradition trees.

### Psionics

The Psionic tradition tree focuses on awakening your population's psionic potential and communing with the Shroud.

Adopting it requires the Psionic Theory technology and either:

- Mind Over Matter ascension perk
- Interdimensional Processing ascension perk
- Teachers of the Shroud origin
- Endbringers origin
- Finished the Forged by the Shroud situation by supporting the Shroud

If the Shadows of the Shroud DLC is enabled, the Great Awakening tradition can only be adopted after the Psionic Ascension situation has reaches stage II.
