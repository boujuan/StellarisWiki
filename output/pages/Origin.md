# Origin

The **origin** represents the background of a species before it unified itself into an empire . In games with randomly generated AI empires, some origins are unique, meaning only one empire with that origin can be generated.

Many origins can only be used by one empire. They will not be generated on more than one random empire and can only appear if the player empire does not have the same origin. Force-spawning empires with the same such origin will not work and will spawn a random empire instead.

Pre-FTL civilizations can only have the Developing Civilization origin. If the First Contact DLC is enabled they can also spawn with the Mechanist, Life-Seeded, Shattered Ring, Ocean Paradise or Subterranean origins, provided their required DLCs are also enabled. If a pre-FTL civilization survives a nuclear war, its origin will be replaced with Post-Apocalyptic.

## Selectable origins

The following origins can be selected when creating an empire. It should be noted that the spawn weight applies to all randomly generated empires, both AI and the player empire if the game was started as a random empire.
