# Leaders

A **leader** is a named character that leads a significant part of the empire , as a Commander, Official or Scientist. Leaders can also be appointed to the council in addition to and concurrent with their regular assignments. Leaders can be reassigned at any point unless their ship is missing-in-action. Gestalt Consciousness empires use nodes rather than council leaders. The name of a leader can be changed at any time by clicking on it.

Each leader has an ethic, determined by the overall ethics of its species' pops. If the empire has a fanatic ethic the starting ruler will always have that ethic. Leader ethics can affect pop ethics the following ways:

- If the leader is assigned to the council the empire will gain +10% attraction towards the leader's ethic.
- If the leader is governing a sector every planet in it that doesn't have a planet governor will gain +25% attraction towards the leader's ethic.
- If the leader is governing a planet it will gain +50% attraction towards the leader's ethic.

## Leader class

Leaders are divided into 3 classes that determine their background, possible assignments, council positions, bonuses, experience sources and available traits.

If the Galactic Paragons DLC is enabled, each class can be further specialized into one of four veteran classes once the leader reaches skill level 4. If the empire is a Gestalt Consciousness, Subclass councilor medium councilor veteran classes are exclusively used by gestalt nodes , are automatically assigned to the corresponding node, and have no effects.

## Leader pool

New leaders are generally gained by recruiting them from the leader pool, which is replenished every 5 years. The leader pool starts with 3 leaders from each class, and the amount can be increased by various factors such as civics, traditions or ascension perks. A leader can be recruited from the pool at the following cost of Unity:

| Level | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII | IX | X |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recruitment Cost | 100 | 170 | 350 | 625 | 1000 | 1475 | 2050 | 2725 | 3500 | 4500 |

Leaders cost a monthly upkeep of 2 Unity per level. Leader upkeep is modified by the following:

| Leader upkeep (empire) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Psychological Profiling tradition | −25% |
| Oppressive Autocracy civic | −20% |
| Endless Upgrades luminary trait | −25% |
| Wise Mentor III luminary trait | −25% |
| Kinship tradition (if or ) | −20% |
| Synchronized Agents tradition | −20% |
| Wise Mentor II luminary trait | −15% |
| Data-Driven Logic Loops tradition | −15% |
| Transcendent Learning ascension | −15% |
| Wise Mentor I luminary trait | −10% |
| Master Bureaucrat councilor trait | −5% |
| Integrated Hive authority | +5% |
| Volitional Hive authority | +5% |
| Elitist luminary trait | +30% |
| Profit Maximization Engines | +50% |
| Selected Lineages leader enhancement policy | +50% |
| Capacity Boosters leader enhancement policy | +100% |

| Leader upkeep (species) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Enhanced Memory robot trait | −25% |
| Enhanced Memory cyborg trait | −25% |
| Elevated Synapses trait | −25% |
| Talented trait | −10% |
| Erudite trait | −10% |
| Learning Algorithms cyborg trait | −10% |
| Neural Limiters cyborg trait | +10% |

| Leader upkeep (own trait) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Adventurous Spirit II leader trait | −25% |
| Adventurous Spirit I leader trait | −10% |
| Limited Cyborg leader trait | −10% |
| Eagerness II leader trait | −10% |
| Eagerness I leader trait | −5% |

Leaders can only be of species with Full Citizenship rights . The chance of getting a leader of a particular species is equal to the proportion of that species in the empire's eligible population.

Once recruited, leaders can be freely and instantly assigned to different posts with no cooldown (for example, moving a governor from one planet to another sector).

Leaders may be dismissed at any time, unless they are the empire ruler. Dismissal is irreversible.

### External leader pool

The external leader pool is separated from the leader pool and allows recruiting leaders from other empires' species. It requires the empires to have a Migration Treaty, be in the same Federation or one empire to be a subject of the other. If either empire is Gestalt Consciousness they must also have the same authority.

## Leader capacity

The number of Leaders from each class that an empire can support without penalty is determined by the leader capacity. Exceeding the leader cap for a class of leaders (officials, commanders, or scientists) gives every leader of that leader class a penalty to both Upkeep upkeep and leader experience gain.

- Upkeep Upkeep penalty is proportional to how much the empire is over the leader cap as a percentage, and applied to all leaders of that class. For example, if the current commander cap is 3 and the empire has 4 commanders, the Upkeep upkeep for all commanders is increased by 4/3 or +33.33% . With 6 commanders upkeep would be increased by 6/3 or +100% .
- Leader experience gain penalty is reduced to (0.85)^(number of leaders over the cap); this penalty is applied multiplicatively to all leaders of that class. For example, if the scientist cap is 3 and the empire has 4 scientists (1 over cap), the XP penalty for all scientists would be 85% (.85^1). With 6 scientists (3 over cap) the XP penalty would be 61.4% (.85^3).
- Note that Legendary Paragons and leaders with the Eager trait below skill level 4 are not counted towards the leader capacity.

The leader cap defaults to 3 per class , modified by a number of possible variables:

| Leader capacity (all classes) 0 | |

## Leader experience

Leader experience is defined by LEADER_EXPERIENCE_REQUIREMENT_BASE_VALUE and LEADER_EXPERIENCE_REQUIREMENT_SCALE_VALUE, which default are 100 and 300. In this case experience to next level increases by 300n + 100 , while n means current level. The following table shows experience of each level.

| Level | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII | IX | X | N |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| exp to next level | 400 | 1100 | 2100 | 3400 | 5000 | 6900 | 9100 | 11600 | 14400 | 17500 | 150n^(2) + 250n |
| exp in total | 400 | 1500 | 3600 | 7000 | 12000 | 18900 | 28000 | 39600 | 54000 | 71500 | 50n(n + 1)(n + 3) |

## Skill level

Skill level determines the effectiveness of leaders, their leader classes, their council positions, and some trait effects. Leaders can get new traits, either positive or negative, when they get a new level and tend to get traits related to their current assignment. Lowest possible skill level is skill level 1, while maximal skill level is skill level 10.

Most leaders start with skill level 1, with a random chance to start with up to 2 skill levels higher. Additionally, the following modifiers will increase the initial skill level:

| Starting skill level (all classes) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Imperial Feedback authority | +2 |
| Capacity Boosters policy | +2 |
| Selected Lineages policy | +1 |
| Vaults of Knowledge, Memory Vaults civic | +1 |

| Starting skill level ( Scientist) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Science Division tradition | +1 |
| Scholarium tier 2 (subject) | +1 |

## Effective Skill

Effective skill increases the effective level of leaders, or the effective level for their council positions (causing councillors to provide greater bonuses than their effective level). The following modifiers affect effective leader and councilor level:

| Effective leader skill level (empire) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Backup Clone leader trait with Biochemical Composure / Regenerative Cloning tradition | +2 |
| Transcendent Aristocracy authority | +1 |
| Optimized Neurology tradition | +1 |

| Replicating Regency authority | +2 |
| Bio-Magnates authority | +2 |
| Virtual Leader Focus policy | +2 |
| Departmental Efficiency agenda | +2 |
| Uncanny Intuition species trait | +2 |

| Shadow Council civic | +1 |
| Vaults of Knowledge, Memory Vaults civic | +1 |
| Shared Benefits tradition | +1 |
| Virtual Research Focus policy | −1 |
| Virtual Unity Focus policy | −1 |

## Negative traits

During their service each leader can get negative trait that may reduce their effectiveness in many different ways. Usually, leaders have a limit of maximum 4 negative traits at base, but this number can be modified by certain factors.

| Leader maximum negative traits (empire) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| One Mind civic | −1 |
| Healthcare Program tradition | −1 |
| Mind and Body tradition | −1 |

| Leader maximum negative traits (species) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Talented trait | −1 |
| Erudite trait | −1 |
| Elevated Synapses trait | −1 |
| Enhanced Memory robot trait | −1 |
| Enhanced Memory cyborg trait | −1 |
| Learning Algorithms cyborg trait | −1 |
| Inquisitive Axioms robot trait | −1 |
| Jinxed trait | +1 |
| Neural Limiters cyborg trait | +1 |

| Leader maximum negative traits (own trait) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Emotional Support Pet leader trait | −1 |
| Robotic Surrogate leader trait | −1 |
| Fallible I leader trait | +1 |
| Fallible II leader trait | +3 |

Leader's chance to gain a negative trait is dependent on their age compared to their lifespan, level and predisposition (randomised on leader spawn). Predisposition chances are as follows:

- 1% chance for 0 base negative trait predisposition
- 4% chance for 1 base negative trait predisposition
- 20% chance for 2 base negative trait predisposition
- 55% chance for 3 base negative trait predisposition
- 20% chance for 4 base negative trait predisposition

Predisposition value is modified by above Leader maximum negative traits factors. Which leads to following formula for mortal leader's chance to gain a negative trait, checked yearly. If a leader is eligible to gain one or more negative traits, their yearly chance to gain such is 2% for each eligible negative trait.

Eligibility = floor(Age * 4/lifespan) + leader_level + predisposition - 8 - total_tier_of_negative_traits * 2

Immortal leaders are treated as if they are at 25% of their lifespan, always. Their chance to gain negative trait is always 1%.

## Lifespan

Each leader has an age in years and has a base guaranteed lifespan of 80 years, which can be increased or decreased various factors, particularly the traits for both species and leaders. Hovering over a leader's age will show the leader's guaranteed lifespan and current chance to die each month. Leaders appear in the leader pool with the following ages:

- 25–45 years by default
- 1–10 years if Mechanical
- 5–10 years if Machine
- 10–20 years if Hive Mind
- 5–20 years if Clone Army origin (only if the empire has not completed the Clone Fertility project)
- 27–38 years if species is Lithoid, regardless of authority or origin

After passing their guaranteed lifespan, leaders have a chance of dying every month. The probability is 0.2% per year that has passed since their guaranteed lifespan. After 20 years past their guaranteed lifespan, this increases to 2% per year.

Leaders from species with the Eternal Machine or Virtual traits will never die of old age.

Leaders can also be killed the following ways:

- Leaders governing a planet can be killed by events if the planet has the Mob Rule planet modifier.
- Commanders have a 10% chance to die when a ship of the largest size in the fleet is destroyed and a 2% divided by number of units chance to die each time they lose an army.
- Scientists can be killed by bad outcomes of Archaeology Sites (about 2.9% chance, depending on the site).

Whenever any leader dies with the Imperial Feedback authority, all leaders will gain 1 month of base research per leader level as stored research, with the research type depending on the leader (see Government page).

### Funeral

When a leader that has been present for at least 2 years and reached at least level 4 dies, there is a chance to have a funeral which gives the empire a modifier for 5 years. The chance increases with the leader's accomplishments and is guaranteed for the empire ruler, while a Luminary leader cannot have a funeral.

Individualist empires will be given four funeral options. Empires with the Deathless Dynasty authority always have an additional fifth option to allow the ruler to consume the deceased leader. The first option will always be a private procession. If the funeral is for a ruler, the "Let the masses mourn" option is guaranteed. The remaining options are randomly selected from available funerals whose requirements are met. Funerals that require a certain ethic require either the leader or the empire to have that ethic. The chance of a funeral that requires an ethic is not increased by the leader and empire sharing that ethic. Gestalt Consciousness empires will only ever have one funeral option, which depends on their authority.

Empires have the following funeral options:

| Funeral | Modifier | Cost | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A private procession will suffice.** | - +5% Monthly unity<br>- −2.5% Happiness | 0 | Individualist |
| **Let the masses mourn.** | - +10% Monthly unity<br>- +5% Happiness | 400–8000 | Individualist |

### Clone leaders

If an empire has either the Biochemical Composure tradition or a Cloning authority, current organic leaders who aren't clones will gain the Backup Clone trait and new leaders have a 25% chance to receive the trait as well. When a leader with the trait dies, they will be replaced by an identical leader with the age of 2-5 years and the trait will be replaced by the Clone Leader trait. Nodes cannot be cloned.

If the empire has both the Biochemical Composure tradition and a Cloning authority, clones have a 33% chance every 3-5 years to gain the Backup Clone trait but the penalties of the Clone Leader trait will stack up to three times.
