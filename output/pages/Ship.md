# Ship

A ship is a spaceborne vessel controlled by an empire. They are the primary way of interacting with objects and entities in the galaxy via specific ship orders. Ships are classified into civilian and military vessels, the former being controlled individually while the latter form fleets. All ships must be constructed at a Starbase or Orbital ring with a shipyard module, or with Federations enabled a Mega Shipyard or a Juggernaut . Each shipyard module can construct or upgrade one ship at a time. Ships can be repaired at any controlled, operational starbase above outpost level.

## Shipsets

Each empire will use a shipset, which determines the appearance of its ships and stations and the texture of its megastructures. Randomly generated empires will always match their shipset to their phenotype, with the Humanoid phenotype using the Mammalian shipset if the Humanoids DLC is not installed.

If the BioGenesis DLC is installed, shipsets have a far greater impact than aesthetics. Ships will be categorized into two types: Mechanical and Biological.

- **Mechanical ships** use Alloys in the construction and upkeep or ships, stations and megastructures. They have 5 shipset-specific ship sizes available: Corvette, Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser and Battleship. Their G-slots can mount torpedo weapons. The Voidcraft tech tree will be expanded to include technologies that unlock or improve ships.
- **Biological ships** use a combination of Alloys and Food in the construction and upkeep or ships, stations and megastructures. They have 4 shipset-specific ship sizes available: Mauler, Weaver, Harbinger and Stinger. Those ships come in three growth stages, while other designs have only a single growth stage. Their G-slots can mount mandible weapons. The Biology tech tree will be expanded to include technologies that unlock or improve ships.

| Shipset | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Arthropoid | Mechanical | Chitin or steel, form or function - there is no distinction. These ships are built less to inspire than to endure, their layered hulls a testament to a philosophy of pure survival. |
| Avian | Mechanical | Graceful and sleek, these versatile vessels embody the beauty of flight. Every curve and contour speaks of a species that views space not as an obstacle, but as an extension of the sky. |
| Fungoid | Mechanical | These bulbous vessels evoke the beauty of fungal blooms. Built for self-sufficiency, specialized systems form intricate internal networks, mirroring the logic of the mycelium. |
| Mammalian | Mechanical | Built to last, these formidable vessels echo their makers' endurance. Dense hulls insulate and protect, while redundant systems ensure survival in the harshest conditions. |
| Molluscoid | Mechanical | Graceful yet durable, these vessels are both shelter and spear. Beneath hardened shells, complex systems regulate power flow and nutrient cycles with quiet efficiency. |
| Reptilian | Mechanical | Boxy and utilitarian, this rugged design evokes the resilience of a predator. Their presence in the void is a testament to the cold-blooded tenacity of their makers. |
| Plantoid | Mechanical | These verdant vessels do not merely travel the stars - they take root among them. Photosynthetic nacelles maintain equilibrium, balancing shipboard biomes. |
| Humanoid | Mechanical | Sturdy and resolute, these vessels are built to endure the trials of deep space. Designed to conquer the unknown, they carry the hopes and dreams of their creators to the farthest stars. |
| Lithoid | Mechanical | Forged by time and pressure, these rocklike vessels embody permanence. Silicon-crystal matrices buttress core systems, drawing strength from the same forces that shape worlds. |
| Necroid | Mechanical | Dark and foreboding, these floating cathedrals are monuments to death and rebirth. Their entropic cores and ritualistic designs whisper of voidborne power and eternal ambition. |
| Imperial | Mechanical | Massive and overbearing, these designs command submission. Reinforced superstructures and redundant systems project an aura of peerless dominion. |
| Aquatic | Mechanical | Flowing yet turgid, these ships channel oceanic power. Aqueous interiors and hydrodynamic contours embody the grace of their creators. |
| Toxoid | Mechanical | These vessels leak fumes, rattle ominously, and defy every regulation - but they run. Fueled by waste and held together by stubborn ingenuity, they endure where others fail. |
| Cybernetic | Mechanical | Chrome gleams, circuits hum, and reflexes are a thing of the past. Direct neural uplinks mean no lag, no limits - just pure, high-octane precision. |
| Machine | Mechanical | These designs reflect the purity of tireless minds. Heat-coiled hulls disperse energy from overclocked mainframes, ensuring flawless operation in the pursuit of absolute efficiency. |
| Mindwarden | Mechanical | Equipped with advanced plating and psi-deflector arrays, these ships are ready to evade, repel, and destroy psionic weaponry. |
| Psionic | Mechanical | These ships are specialized for psionic crews. Mind interfaces ensure flight and combat control takes place at the speed of thought. |
| Infernal | Mechanical | The bright, molten heat of these ships burns away the cold darkness of space itself. Their tough panels barely contain the fire of the worlds their makers call home. |
| Shellcraft | Biological | Bred for the bold, these hard-shelled starships do not serve - they endure, growing alongside the fearless explorers that call them home. |
| Spinovore | Biological | Born as much as built, these living warships embody apex predation. Their semi-sentient biomass adapts, hunts, and strikes with insatiable will. |

## Civilian ships

Civilian ships represent all unarmed vessels of an empire and are controlled individually. Their shields, armor, and core components are automatically upgraded once the next tier component tech is unlocked at no cost, and they do not need to return to a Starbase to receive component upgrades. Each civilian ship, excluding transports, has a monthly maintenance cost of 1 energy. Construction and Science ships cost 100 alloys to build. For biological shipset, they cost 175 food and 50 alloys to build instead.

Civilian ships use the evasive fleet stance by default, meaning that they will attempt to escape the system whenever a hostile fleet enters it. They can also be set to a passive stance to ignore hostile fleets.

### Construction ship

Construction ships are used to build every space structure. They are not used up during construction, meaning that they can go on to do other tasks after they have finished their building project. Construction ships also have a Fleet Order that makes them build mining and research stations automatically. Construction ships can construct the following:

| Build order | Mechanical cost | Biological cost | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Outpost | 75 per hyperlane from closest owned system 100 if not Machine Intelligence 150 if Machine Intelligence | 75 per hyperlane from closest owned system 50 if not Machine Intelligence 175 if not Machine Intelligence 75 if Machine Intelligence 263 if Machine Intelligence | The Starbase is a space station used to claim star systems and expand your borders. It can only be built in orbit around a star. The full cost is dependent on which star system is being claimed. |
| Mining Station | 100 Minerals | 125 Food | Mining Stations are used to collect Minerals, Energy Credits and Strategic Resources from uninhabited planets, stars and asteroids. Mining Stations that collect Energy do not cost any upkeep. |
| Research Station | 100 Minerals | 125 Food | Research Stations are used to collect Physics, Society and Engineering research data from uninhabited planets, stars and asteroids. |
| Observation Post | 100 Minerals | 125 Food | Observation Posts can be built in orbit around planets inhabited by primitive civilizations to study their society. |
| Megastructure Site | depends on Megastructure | depends on Megastructure | Megastructures are truly massive construction projects only possible in the zero-g environment of space. |

Tier 3 Bulwark subjects can construct Battlewright construction ships, which provide all friendly ships in the same system 5% Daily Hull Regen.

### Science ship

See also: Surveying

Science ships are the primary method of exploring the galaxy and the stars and systems within it. They require a scientist to operate.

Once crewed, the science ship can conduct a survey of individual objects within a system. During these surveys, it can discover resources present on a celestial object (i.e.: planets, stars, asteroids, etc.). A survey may also result in the discovery of an anomaly . The science ship can also investigate debris left after a space battle which may yield research points or possibly even unlock unique technology options. Crewed science ships are also required to excavate Archaeological Sites or explore an Astral Rift.

Tier 3 Scholarium subjects can construct Arctrellis science ships, which penalize all enemy ships with AI combat computers in the same system with −25% to Accuracy, Fire Rate, and Ship Speed.

Science ships will always equip the most advanced cloaking device researched.

### Colony ship

See also: Colonization

Colony ships allow an empire to settle habitable planets or megastructures in owned systems. When ordering the construction of a colony ship, the player is given the option of choosing the species or sub-species of the pop(s) that is sent to the new colony. Pops are neither consumed nor transported in this process. Once constructed, the colony ship may be sent to any habitable world within an owned system to start a colony. Colony ships take one year to build and their upkeep cost is maintained throughout the whole colonization process. Colony ships can also be built through the interface of the world to be colonized, which automatically queues the colonization order as long as the path is not blocked. Selecting a colony ship will display the species inside.

Species require the Colonization Allowed species rights to be selected for new colony ships and if the species rights are changed afterwards those colony ships will not be able to colonize worlds.

The cost of a colony ship depends on the empire and its founder species class.

Empires with the Corporate Dominion or Private Prospectors civics can also construct **Private Colony Ships** , which cost 500 energy instead.

Empires with the Calamitous Birth origin can also construct **Lithoid Meteorites** , which cost 500 minerals instead, have no upkeep cost, and take only 150 days to build. Lithoid Meteorites also have a much faster sublight speed than regular colony ships. A planet colonized by a lithoid meteorite gains two Buried Lithoids blockers and the Lithoid Crater modifier.

Empires with Genesis Guides civic or equal variants cannot construct regular colony ships, they construct **Genesis Arks** instead. A planet colonized by a Genesis Ark gains a species with 300 Pre-Sapient pops and Genesis Preserve planetary feature.

Empires with Synthetic Fertility origin have same cost as Mechanical empires.

Empires with Wilderness origin cannot construct colony ships, they colonize worlds by terraforming instead.

Councilors with the Frontier Spirit trait reduce the cost of colony ships by −10% .

### Transport ship

Transport ships are the space based form of assault armies . An army embarking from a planet will automatically generate a transport ship to house it, with the option to automatically "deploy in orbit" being enabled by default on all worlds. While armies have an upkeep cost, transport ships cost no additional energy to maintain. Transport ships are collected in fleets like military ships, but cannot be combined with military ships and are not listed in the fleet manager.

During war, transport ships must be carefully escorted by a military fleet since they are unarmed. Their only purpose is to carry assault armies into enemy planets so that they can occupy them. Transport fleets use the passive fleet stance by default, and can be set to use the aggressive stance, which will cause them to follow a military fleet and land on enemy planets with similar or less army strength. Additionally, some special projects require a transport ship to be completed.

Transport ships will always equip the most advanced cloaking device researched.

## Military ships

See also: Space warfare

Military ships represent the armed vessels of an empire. Military ships require both Energy and Alloys as monthly maintenance. Military ships have a number of base stats, but derive most of their stats from components. A military ships components can be customized via the ship designer .

Military ships are classified by their hull size, which determines their base combat stats, base cost, and available sections. There are five regular hull sizes available: Corvette, Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, and Battleship; the Apocalypse expansion adds a sixth regular hull size – the Titan. Empires with the Progenitor Hive origin can construct more powerful Offspring versions of Corvettes, Destroyers, Cruisers and Battleships, while empires with the Galactic Nemesis ascension perk eventually are able to construct Menacing Corvettes, Destroyers and Cruisers.

Titans can only be built at a Citadel-level starbase with a Titan Assembly Yards or a completed Mega Shipyard. The other regular classes can be built at any starbase or orbital ring with a shipyard module, or at a Mega Shipyard or Juggernaut.

Except for Titans, each ship class has a Voidcraft technology: Standardized <class> Patterns , which reduces build cost by −5% and increases build speed by +25% . Each class also has two Voidcraft hull improvement technologies: Improved <size> Hulls and Advanced <size> Hulls , which each add +10% hull points. Corvettes and Frigates share these technologies, rather than each having their own.

Some non-playable factions have access to unique hull sizes not usually available to players. Fallen Empires have Battlecruisers and Escorts, presenting an almost direct upgrade to Battleships and Destroyers respectively.

### Fleets

A Fleet is a group of military or transport ships operating as a single unit and can be assigned a Commander to act as an admiral or general respectively. Military fleets each maintain a fleet template accessible through the fleet manager and can be assigned a home base to return to automatically. All ships within a fleet must remain within the same system and will synchronize their FTL methods to remain together, though ships can be merged with a fleet anywhere in the galaxy. Merging can either be performed manually between specific ships, or automatically by reinforcing a fleet with missing ships in its fleet template. Reinforcing immediately begins building the most amount of ships possible at the nearest available starbase, with ships entering transit mode to try and reach the same system as their target fleet as soon as they are finished building. Manually built military ships will instead attempt to automatically merge with any fleets in orbit around the same starbase, splitting off into a new fleet if no fleets are found or if none have sufficient fleet command limit available.

### Upgrading ships

Whenever a design is updated, military ships of that design must be upgraded manually at a starbase or orbital ring with a shipyard module, Mega Shipyard, or Juggernaut. The cost of upgrading a ship is the difference in construction cost between the new design and the current one. If the newer design costs less of a resource than the current one, then the upgrade cost is free but resources are not refunded. Each ship upgrades individually, with multiple ships being upgraded simultaneously if the starbase (or equivalent) contains multiple shipyards.

When upgrading a ship, the system attempts to use the current version of the same design name. If no design of the same name exists, then the upgrade process retrofits them to the most-recently saved design of the same ship class instead.

Ships obtained from events that contain components not yet researched should not be allowed to upgrade; upgrading these ships replaces the unresearched components with the latest researched ones, even if those are inferior.

### Naval capacity

Naval capacity represents the number of military ships that an empire can effectively support. Going beyond this limit will increase ship maintenance costs by a percentage proportional to the exceeded capacity. For example, if an empire were to exceed its naval capacity by 50% , it would increase the maintenance cost of each ship by 50% . An empire's base naval capacity is 20 and is modified by the following:

| Naval capacity 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Unknown Civilian difficulty | +100% |
| Unknown Cadet difficulty | +50% |
| Mutual Defense resolutions | +10% / +20% / +30% / +40% / +50% |
| Fanatic Purifiers civic | +33% |
| Devouring Swarm / Terravore civic | +33% |
| Determined Exterminator civic | +33% |
| Supremacist diplomatic stance | +20% |
| Fleet Logistics Corp tradition | +20% |
| A Grand Fleet edict | +20% |
| Citizen Service civic | +15% |
| Subspace Ephapse civic | +15% |
| Naval Contractors civic | +15% |
| Belligerent diplomatic stance | +10% |
| Master's Teachings: Warring States edict | +10% |
| The Crusade of Steel edict | +10% |
| Unknown The Tithe of the Navy empire modifier | +10% |
| Leveraged Privateering resolution (2) | −10% |
| Holistic Asset Coordination resolution (4) | −15% |
| Demobilization Initiative resolution (5) | −25% |
| Minister of Defense unassigned or absent | −25% |
| We Come in Peace agenda | −25% |
| Satrapy | −30% |
| Scholarium tier 1 | −30% |
| Scholarium tier 2 | −40% |
| Scholarium tier 3 | −50% |
| Defense Privatization resolutions | −10% / −25% / −40% / −60% / −80% |

Maximum Naval Capacity may never exceed 9999 but empires can still build over it as long as their economy supports the upkeep costs.

Titans have a strict build limit, with a base of 1 allowed per empire; every 200 Naval Capacity increases an empire's Titan build limit by 1, up to a maximum of 20 Titans at 3800 naval capacity.

Offspring ships have a strict build limit too:

- Every 1 Naval Capacity increases Offspring Corvette cap by 1
- Every 2 Naval Capacity increases Offspring Destroyer cap by 1
- Every 4 Naval Capacity increases Offspring Cruiser cap by 1
- Every 8 Naval Capacity increases Offspring Battleship cap by 1

#### Naval coverage

Naval coverage is equal to twice the naval capacity used and is used to calculate power projection . Power projection adds monthly influence based on the ratio of naval coverage to empire size. If naval coverage equals or exceeds empire size, power projection adds +2 monthly influence; Imperial authority empires gain +3 monthly influence instead. If naval coverage is less than empire size, power projection is scaled by the percentage ratio. For example, with naval coverage of 50 and empire size of 100 (i.e. 50%), power projection would add +1 monthly influence, or +1.5 monthly influence for imperial authority.

### Fleet command limit

Fleet command limit determines how large any one individual fleet in an empire can be. An empire's base command limit is 50, increased by the following:

| Fleet command limit 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Galactic Force Projection ascension perk | +100 |
| War Games tradition | +20 |
| Doctrine: Space Combat technology | +20 |
| Doctrine: Reactive Formations technology | +20 |
| Doctrine: Interstellar Warfare technology | +20 |
| Doctrine: Fluid Fleet Templates technology | +20 |
| Doctrine: Armada Battle Formation technology | +20 |
| Admiralty Support Staff technology (repeatable 5 times) | +10 |
| Destroyers tech | +10 |
| Cruisers tech | +10 |
| Battleships tech | +10 |
| Titans tech | +10 |
| Distinguished Admiralty civic | +20 |

### Ship rank

As ships partake in battle, they will increase their rank. Ships start with zero experience. Ships gain Special +5 experience every day they are in combat.

Ranks are classified as follows:

| Rank | Exp Points | Damage | Health Hull Points | Evasion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Regular | 0-99 | **0** | **0** | **0** |
| Experienced | 100-999 | +10% | **0** | **0** |
| Veteran | 1000-9999 | +20% | +5% | +5% |
| Elite | 10000 | +40% | +10% | +10% |

Ship starting experience can be increased by the following:

| Source | Effect |
|---|---|
| Fleet Supremacy edict | +100 |
| Martial Alliance federation | +100 |
| Built from a Starbase with a Fleet Academy building | +100 |
| Built from a Mega Shipyard | +100 |
| Inspired Commander III ruler trait | +300 |
| Inspired Commander II ruler trait | +150 |
| Inspired Commander ruler trait | +75 |
| Retired Fleet Officer councilor trait | +200 |
| Navy Instructor II councilor trait | +200 |
| Navy Instructor councilor trait | +120 |
| Lord High Admiral council position | +50 per level |
| Military Overseer | +500 |

## Colossal ships

Colossal ships are the largest ships an empire can construct. There are three classes of colossal ships: the Colossus, the Juggernaut, and the Star-Eater. Each Colossal Ship requires a citadel with the Colossal Assembly Yards building or a Mega-Shipyard to be constructed and all colossal ships apart from the Star-Eater can only be constructed once, though they can be rebuilt if lost. Integrating a subject with a colossal ship in its navy will grant the ship to the overlord, bypassing the limit, however these additional ships cannot be rebuilt once lost. Colossal ships cannot use the Phase Fleet order if unlocked.

### Colossus

The colossus is a single-purpose weapons platform built around a Planet-Killer weapon slot, a weapon of mass destruction capable of affecting an entire world. Colossi lack the weapons to attack enemy fleets and, during space battles, will ignore enemies entirely to maneuver straight to its designated target. This means that the colossus will do things such as going straight through an ongoing space battle to fire upon an enemy world, unless its stance is set to Evasive. Each Fallen Empire has a 10% chance to start the game with a colossus and can build more if they have awakened. Constructing a Colossus requires the Colossi technology, which can be obtained by taking the Colossus Project ascension perk and then finishing the special project it offers. When the special project is halfway completed, the empire is prompted to choose a starting colossus weapon. The empire can later research other types of colossus weapons and retrofit it into their colossus via the ship designer.

An empire that owns a colossus gains the Colossus casus belli on every empire and gives every empire the Stop Colossus casus belli on it. If the colossus is destroyed during such a war the casus belli are lost but this will not affect wars already declared.

Using a colossus causes large amounts of war exhaustion on the targeted empire and gives it +50% ethics attraction towards Militarist and Xenophobe, causing the diplomatic and political climate of a region to grow increasingly hostile over time.

Targeting a world with a pre-FTL civilization requires owning the system and the Aggressive Interference Native Interference policy. Using a colossus on a pre-FTL civilization gives −40 Opinion with every empire that is not Xenophobe, Xenophile or Genocidal and −60 Opinion with every empire that is Xenophile.

A colossus can carry the following weapons:

| | Weapon | Effects | Opinion when used (stacks up to 5x) | Requirements for research | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ship part global pacifier | Global Pacifier | - The celestial object is irreversibly turned into a Shielded variant<br>- It gains a deposit of 10 Society Research | - −200 Victim<br>- −20 Victim's Federation<br>- −20 Egalitarian, Xenophile, Militarist, | | If used on a Holy World, the Holy Guardians will instantly awaken and declare a war on the perpetrator |

#### Unique colossi

Certain colossus ships may be fought during the game and obtained after defeating them. They do not count towards the single-colossus limit and unlike the constructed version they are armed.

- **The Toxic Entity** is a guardian created at the end of the Knights of the Toxic God story. If the empire with the origin defeats it, it will gain the option to take control of the colossus. The colossus has a weapon that turns habitable planets into Toxic Worlds with the Toxic Terraforming Candidate modifier and causes the same Opinion penalties as World Crackers.
- **Cetana's Colossus** is used by the Synthetic Queen crisis and can be obtained by defeating her via the Shroud option. It uses a World Cracker and has the biggest component loadout in the game.

### Juggernaut

The Juggernaut is the mobile center of operations of an entire empire, equipped with shipyards that can construct, repair, and upgrade ships the same way a starbase can. It has 10 times the hull points of a Titan and features six Hangar slots and two turreted Extra Large slots. It also has its own set of aura components , which are significantly more powerful than the Titan's auras. Juggernauts do not have logistical upkeep and reduce the logistical upkeep of ships in the same system by 75%.

Juggernauts have 6 shipyards and can thus build or upgrade up to 6 ships at a time. It cannot build Titans or colossal ships, but it can upgrade or repair them. It can also upgrade itself, or upgrade at any shipyard if its own shipyards are busy.

The Juggernaut will automatically start repairing itself after a battle like most stations, and it neither can nor needs to be repaired at a starbase.

Juggernauts can retreat and go Missing in Action to reappear at the nearest friendly starbase like all regular fleets. Fleets can set a Juggernaut as their homebase, though the target location of a "return to homebase", "repair", or "upgrade" order will fail to update in real time if the Juggernaut is still in motion.

The Galactic Defense Force and Imperial Armada can have their own Juggernaut, allowing the Custodian or Galactic Emperor to have two.

Fallen Empires do not have access to the single-Juggernaut cap and cannot build them.

### Star-Eater

The Star-Eater is a massive superweapon used by the Crisis Aspirant after reaching the fifth tier of the Galactic Nemesis progression level and declaring war against the Galaxy as an Existential Threat.

The main weapon of a Star-Eater is a Star Cracker that targets the core of a star, collapsing the celestial object into a black hole and destroying the surrounding solar system while collecting massive amounts of dark matter to fuel the Aetherophasic Engine. Reaching the final crisis level grants the Crisis Aspirant two Star-Eaters as well as the technology to build more. Unlike Colossi, Star-Eaters are equipped with regular weapon slots and therefore can engage in regular fleet combat and will always cost an unchanging amount of dark matter to build regardless of the design. Star-Eaters do not require components to be fully powered in order to save a design.

All fleets present except the firing Star-Eater will go MIA. If a system contains multiple stars, firing upon any of them destroys all stars in the system. Cracking a star grants dark matter based on the galaxy size:

| Galaxy size | Dark matter |
|---|---|
| Tiny | 3000 |
| Small | 2500 |
| Medium | 2000 |
| Large | 1500 |
| Huge | 1000 |

Star-Eaters can target owned stars as well, unless the system contains the empire capital.

## Cloaking

Cloaking allows a fleet to become invisible and ignore closed borders and will not become MIA if war is declared against the system's current owner. It also allows a Science Ship to conduct Active Reconnaissance. However most cloaking components will disable shields and even the ones that don't impose certain restrictions on shields. A ship can only cloak every 120 days and will automatically decloak if attacking. Ships and fleets that are cloaked are marked with horizontal stripes on the galaxy map. Science and transport ships are always equipped with the latest researched cloaking device.

Each ship has a Cloaking Strength, and each fleet has a Cloaking Strength determined by the lowest one of all ships in the fleet. It determines what penalties a fleet will suffer while cloaked as well as how easy it is to detect.

| Cloaking Strength | Sublight Speed | Time Hyper Jump Charge Time | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Non-Existent** | Cannot cloak | Cannot cloak | This fleet is incapable of projecting a Cloaking Field. |
| **Very Low (1)** | −50% | +125% | This fleet is capable of projecting a severely unstable Cloaking Field, with significant limitations of Sublight Speed and Hyper Jump Charge Time. |
| **Low (2)** | −40% | +100% | This fleet is capable of projecting an unstable Cloaking Field, with major limitations of Sublight Speed and Hyper Jump Charge Time. |
| **Medium (3)** | −30% | +75% | This fleet is capable of projecting a Cloaking Field of normal stability, with some limitations of Sublight Speed and Hyper Jump Charge Time. |
| **High (4)** | −20% | +50% | This fleet is capable of projecting a high stability Cloaking Field, with minor limitations of Sublight Speed and Hyper Jump Charge Time. |
| **Very High (5)** | −10% | +25% | This fleet is capable of projecting an incredibly stable Cloaking Field, with insignificant limitations of Sublight Speed and Hyper Jump Charge Time. |
| **Exceptional 6+** | No penalty | No penalty | This fleet is capable of projecting an exceptionally stable Cloaking Field, without any limitations of Sublight Speed and Hyper Jump Charge Time. |

Cloaking Strength can be increased by the following, up to the maximum of 10 :

- +1-5 by cloaking ship Auxiliary components, depending on the size of the ship and the level of the component. A ship without a cloaking device can't cloak, even if it would gain additional strength from other sources.
- +1 from finishing the Subterfuge tradition tree
- +1 from the Criminal Heritage civic
- +1 from the Dark Consortium Obsidian Veil edict
- +1 from the Astral Cloaking edict
- +1 from the Trickster admiral trait
- +1 from the Material Liberator II commander trait
- +2 from the Guerilla Tactician commander trait
- +2 from the Enigmatic Engineering ascension perk
- +2 from forming a covenant with Whisperers in the Void
- +2 from the Confidential Research I scientist trait
- +3 from the Confidential Research II scientist trait
- +3 from the Confidential Research III scientist trait
- +3 if the fleet is inside a Nebula
- +10 if the fleet is inside a Stardust Storm

A cloaked fleet will be detected if it is within the sensor range of a starbase with Detection Strength higher than or equal to the fleet's Cloaking Strength, or the empires have max Intel on the cloaked fleet owner, or have sensor link with an empire that detected the fleet. Non-allied cloaked fleets, once detected, are forced to decloak in border.
