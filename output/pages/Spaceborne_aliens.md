# Spaceborne aliens

**Spaceborne aliens** are non- empire creatures and entities encountered in space. Spaceborne aliens have increased stats based on the difficulty settings .

## Space pirates

Space pirates will appear every 10 years for every empire that has a world that produces at least 1000 Trade and an unowned system on the empire border. The strength of the pirate fleet depends on how many years have passed since the start of the game.

| Years | Ships |
|---|---|
| 10 | 10 Reaver, 4 Brigand |
| 20 | 6 Reaver, 6 Brigand |
| 30 | 6 Brigand, 6 Skull |
| 40 | 8 Skull, 4 Marauder |
| 50 | 6 Brigand, 6 Skull, 4 Marauder, 2 Corsair |
| 60 | 6 Brigand, 6 Skull, 4 Marauder, 4 Corsair, 2 Cruiser |
| 70 | 6 Brigand, 6 Skull, 4 Marauder, 4 Corsair, 2 Cruiser |
| 80 | 6 Brigand, 8 Skull, 4 Marauder, 4 Corsair, 4 Cruiser |
| 90 | 2 Cruiser, 1 Battleship |
| 100+ | 6 Brigand, 6 Skull, 1 Battleship |

The first pirate fleet will appear outside empire borders but subsequent pirate fleets will appear within borders, with worlds producing more Trade being more likely to spawn pirates. If the pirates succeed in disabling the system's starbase, then the system will succumb to the pirate attack and be occupied by a pirate station. The rewards from destroying a pirate station are randomly selected, with a weighting based on the number of years since game start. The table below shows the chance of each reward based on the current game year; all percentages are rounded to one decimal place and so may not sum to 100%

| Reward Doubled 100 years after game start | | Years since game start | | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <=80 | 80-100 | 101-120 | 121-140 | 141-160 | 161-180 | 181-200 | 201+ | | |
| Small | 80 0 50 0 | 47.6% | 39.8% | 32.0% | 24.8% | 18.3% | 12.9% | 0 8.7% | 0 5.7% |
| Medium | 180 100 | 33.3% | 34.8% | 35.1% | 33.9% | 31.3% | 27.6% | 23.4% | 19.0% |
| Large | 300 150 | 14.3% | 17.9% | 21.6% | 25.1% | 27.8% | 29.5% | 29.9% | 29.1% |
| Huge | 600 300 | 0 4.8% | 7.5% | 11.3% | 16.3% | 22.6% | 30.0% | 38.0% | 46.3% |

Space pirates use the following designs:

### Bemat Thalassocracy

The Bemat Thalassocracy is a hostile pirate fleet that can appear only once after the end-game year is reached. It appears in a system owned by an empire that produces at least 180 Trade. The fleet led by a level 4 Commander with the following ships:

| 40 corvettes | 35 destroyers | 34 cruisers |
|---|---|---|
| - 1 Kinetic T3<br>- 1 Plasma T1<br>- 1 Disruptor T1<br>- 2 Shield T2<br>- 1 Afterburners T2<br>- 1 Shield Capacitor<br>- Jump Drive<br>- Impulse Thrusters<br>- Gravitic Sensors<br>- Zero-Point Reactor<br>- Basic Combat Computer | - 1 Plasma T3<br>- 1 Plasma T3<br>- 3 Laser T5<br>- 4 Shield T4<br>- 2 Armor T3<br>- 1 Shield Capacitor<br>- Jump Drive<br>- Plasma Thrusters<br>- Gravitic Sensors<br>- Zero-Point Reactor<br>- Advanced Combat Computer (Line) | - 1 Missiles T5<br>- 2 Swarmer Missiles T1<br>- 2 Disruptor T2<br>- 2 Plasma T3<br>- 2 Kinetic T3<br>- 5 Shield T4<br>- 3 Armor T3<br>- 1 Auxiliary Fire Control<br>- 1 Nanite Repair System<br>- Jump Drive<br>- Plasma Thrusters<br>- Gravitic Sensors<br>- Zero-Point Reactor<br>- Advanced Combat Computer (Artillery) |

## Space fauna

Space fauna are entities which may not even classify as ships or life in the common meaning of those words. They generally inhabit a certain area of space and are seldom seen away from it. Some are peaceful unless provoked, while others are inherently hostile. If killed, space fauna slowly respawns in their home system.

### Tiyanki

| “ | Tiyanki, also known as "Space Whales", are typically docile creatures that graze on atmospheric gasses. These creatures are extremely collaborative and pods in the wild are organized under a strict hierarchy. — In-game description | ” |
|---|---|---|

The Tiyanki are peaceful migratory space fauna. Completing the First Contact with them will unlock the Frequency Tuning technology.

The Tiyanki have two home systems:

- The first is called Tiyana Vek. It contains 4 Gas Giants that have a deposit of 6 Society each and the star has a deposit of 6 Physics.
- The second is called Tiyun Ort. Its various celestial object deposits produce 6 Physics and 3 Volatile Motes. The ice asteroid Zhaduva contains a level 3 anomaly that will add another deposit of 3 Society. The unique world Orek Vuul contains the archaeology site **Tiyanki Grave Mound** .

Tiyanki come in 4 growth stages. With Grand Archive DLC, they can be cloned using Food.

| Growth stage | Size | Age | Reproductive status | Culling resources per rarity | Hatching time | Components | Reward if killed (natural-grown fauna only) | Base Hull | Base Armor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tiyanki Hatchling | 1 | 0-14y | | 15 Food | Time 60 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Regenerative Hull Tissue | - 150 Energy<br>- 15 Exotic Gases | 500 | 200 |
| Tiyanki Calf | 2 | 15-29y | | 30 Food | Time 120 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Regenerative Hull Tissue | - 250 Energy<br>- 25 Exotic Gases | 1100 | 300 |
| Ship category tiyanki bull Tiyanki Bull Tiyanki Cow | 4 | 30-79y | 12 months | 60 Food | Time 240 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Regenerative Hull Tissue | - 500 Energy<br>- 50 Exotic Gases | 2400 | 500 |
| Tiyanki Ox | 8 | 80y+ | 12 months | 120 Food | Time 480 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Energy Siphon, Regenerative Hull Tissue | - 1000 Energy<br>- 50 Exotic Gases | 5000 | 1500 |

If an empire kills the last Tiyanki fleet and the Enigmatic Observers fallen empire is present, the empire gains a temporary −100 Opinion with them.

### Crystalline entities

| “ | Crystalline Entities are a unique form of silicate-animate beings that can freely propel themselves through space. The hue of each entity varies not due to age, but as a reflection of their latent internal charge. — In-game description | ” |
|---|---|---|

Crystalline Entities keep to their systems until the Mid-Game year is reached, at which point they can expand. Once the First Contact is completed, the empire will be offered the following choices:

- All empires can choose to gain a special project that costs 1500 Physics Research. Once completed, it will grant a choice between the Crystal Focus empire modifier or the Crystal-Infused Plating technology.
- Empires that are Militarist, Xenophobe or Genocidal can choose to gain the Crystal Hunter empire modifier.
- Empires that are Pacifist or value others can gain a special project that costs 5000 Physics Research and renders Crystalline Entities non-aggressive towards them and unlocks the Crystal-Infused Plating technology as a permanent research option.

The Crystalline Entities home system is a Pulsar that contains the Crystal Nidus, a large crystalline structure guarded by 4 elite fleets.

Crystalline Entities come in 3 growth stages. With Grand Archive DLC, they can be cloned using Minerals and Rare Crystals.

| Growth stage | Size | Age | Reproductive status | Culling resources per rarity | Hatching time | Components | Base Hull |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Crystal Shardling | 1 | 0-39y | | 2 Rare Crystals | Time 60 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Small Shard Thrower, Small Shard Thrower, Small Shard Thrower, Small Crystal-Infused Plating, Small Crystal-Infused Plating, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 300 |
| Crystal Shard | 2 | 40-79y | | 4 Rare Crystals | Time 120 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Medium Shard Thrower, Small Shard Thrower, Small Shard Thrower, Small Shard Thrower, Small Shard Thrower, Small Crystal-Infused Plating, Small Crystal-Infused Plating, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 650 |
| Crystal Quintessence | 4 | 80y+ | 12 months | 8 Rare Crystals | Time 240 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Large Shard Thrower, Medium Shard Thrower, Medium Shard Thrower, Medium Shard Thrower, Medium Shard Thrower, Small Crystal-Infused Plating, Small Crystal-Infused Plating, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 1400 |

### Space amoeba

| “ | Space Amoeba are lone predators, aggressive towards anything they encounter. Supported by partially-formed spawn known as "flagella", these creatures are adept at chasing down their prey. — In-game description | ” |
|---|---|---|

Space Amoeba are migratory space fauna. Once the First Contact is completed, the empire will be offered the following choices:

- All empires can choose to gain a Special Project that costs 1500 Society Research. Once completed, it will grant a choice between the Flagellating Movement empire modifier or the Regenerative Hull Tissue technology.
- Empires that are Militarist, Xenophobe or Genocidal can choose to gain the Amoeba Hunter empire modifier.
- Empires that are Pacifist or value others can gain a special project that costs 5000 Physics Research and renders Space Amoeba non-aggressive towards them and unlocks the Regenerative Hull Tissue technology as a permanent research option.

The Space Amoeba home system is called Amor Alveo and is guarded by 7 Space Amoeba fleets. Its various celestial object deposits produce in total 8 Energy, 12 Minerals, 6 Society, 3 Exotic Gases, 3 Volatile Motes and 2 Rare Crystals.

If the Galactic Community is formed, the Space Amoeba pacification modifier can be offered to all members by passing Space Amoeba Protection Act , but the resolution can only be proposed by empires which already pacified them.

Space Ameoba come in 2 growth stages. With Grand Archive DLC, they can be cloned using Food.

| Growth stage | Size | Age | Reproductive status | Culling resources per rarity | Hatching time | Components | Base Hull | Base Armor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Space Amoeba | 1 | 0-29y | | 30 Physics Research | Time 60 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Small Amoeba Weapon, Small Amoeba Weapon, Small Amoeba Weapon, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 300 | 100 |
| Space Amoeba Mother | 4 | 30y+ | 6 months | 60 Physics Research | Time 240 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Amoeba Flagella, Large Amoeba Weapon, Small Amoeba Weapon, Small Amoeba Weapon, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 2000 | 1500 |

### Voidworms

| “ | Voidworms are parasitic organisms that must deposit spores on inhabited worlds with suitable biomass in order to reproduce. Mature individuals form mating trios, known as "Troikas", and will construct nests near black holes to shelter and raise their young. — In-game description | ” |
|---|---|---|

Voidworms spawn in a single system and will slowly multiply, the speed depending on galaxy settings. Once the First Contact is completed, the empire will be offered a choice between the Voidworms Hunter empire modifier or a special project that costs 5000 Society Research and gives a choice between the Voidworm Enzymes empire modifier or the Voidworm Immunity technology as a research option.

Voidworm adults do not grow beyond the age of 65. Instead, if 3 Voidworm Adults of age 65 are in the same fleet or the Vivarium, they will fuse into a Voidworm Troika, which can use the Voidworm Spores orbital bombardment.

The Voidworms home system is a Black Hole with 3 Toxic Worlds with a deposit of 1 Dark Matter on each. It contains 3 nests, 3 Adults which will soon merge into a Troika, 9 Juveniles and 9 Nymphs. Juveniles travel across the galaxy up to 25 hyperlanes away from the home system while Nymphs will stay in the home system. The nests will periodically spawn voidworms depending on galaxy settings. If Toxoids is installed, the Toxic Worlds will have the Toxic Terraforming Candidate modifier.

For the first 35 years, voidworms are not aggressive unless attacked. After 35 years have passed, they will become aggressive towards any empire within 20 hyperlane jumps of their nest. Any planet with at least 1000 pops can be targeted by a Voidworm Troika, which will try to bombard the planet until 300 pops are killed (100 on Civilian difficulty). Afterwards the same empire cannot be attacked again for 25 years.

Voidworms come in 4 growth stages. They can be cloned using Food and Minerals.

| Space creature | Size | Age | Reproductive status | Culling resources per rarity | Hatching time | Components | Base Hull | Base Armor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Voidworm Nymph | 1 | 0-14y | | 30 Society Research | Time 60 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Spikespores, Voidworm Fangs, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 400 | 0 |
| Voidworm Juvenile | 2 | 15-59y | | 60 Society Research | Time 120 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Spikespores, Spikespores, Voidworm Fangs, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 800 | 200 |
| Voidworm Adult | 8 | 60-65y | | 120 Society Research | Time 240 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Spikespores, Spikespores, Spikespores, Voidworm Fangs, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 4000 | 1000 |
| Voidworm Troika | 16 | 65y+ | 3 months | 240 Society Research | No | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Spikespores, Spikespores, Spikespores, Spikespores, Spikespores, Spikespores, Spikespores, Voidworm Fangs, Voidworm Fangs, Voidworm Fangs, Regenerative Hull Tissue, Regenerative Hull Tissue, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 12000 | 3000 |

#### Voidworm plague

The Voidworm Plague is a crisis that can take place while there are any Voidworm Nests remaining after the mid-game start year. The chance ranges from 1% to 50% each year, depending on the number of Voidworms present in the galaxy above a certain minimum defined by galaxy settings.

If a Voidworm Plague takes place, all Voidworms will become hostile and 3 times more powerful. Their bombardment will no longer end at the last 1000 Pops and the Voidworm Immunity technology will no longer protect against it. 3 additional Voidworm Troikas will spawn in their home system. Every year, each Voidworm Nest will spawn 9 Nymphs, 6 Juveniles, 3 Adults and 3 Troikas. Voidworms will reach the next growth stage 3 times faster in their home system. Each empire will gain the Voidworm Plague situation. Any empire that completes the situation will no longer be invaded by Voidworms.

The empire that destroys the last Voidworm Nest after the Voidworm Plague took place will gain the Voidworm Heart specimen.

### Cutholoids

| “ | Cutholoids are massive organisms that inhabit asteroids in order to provide suitable protection for their otherwise soft bodies. This creature swallows its prey whole, using radioactive digestive fluid to slowly consume its prey. — In-game description | ” |
|---|---|---|

Cutholoids are spaceborne aliens hidden in asteroids belts. They will not spawn in systems bordering an empire's home system. The more Asteroids the system has, the more likely it is to contain Cutholoids. Cutholoids will respawn if too many of them are killed. How many systems will contain Cutholoids as well as how few they have to be to begin respawning depends on galaxy settings.

The first time an asteroid hiding a Cutholoid is surveyed, it will swallow the science ship and its leader unless the science ship is cloaked and will issue a special project to recover them. The special project needs 6 months to complete and must be finished within 5 years. The rescued leader has a 50% chance to gain the Maimed, Cutholoid Victim trait. The special project requires one of the following:

- A fleet with at least 1000 Fleet Power. When the special project is completed the Cutholoid will attack the fleet but killing it leaves behind debris that gives either 1000 Minerals or 200 Rare Crystals.
- A science ship and the Gravity Snares technology. When the special project is completed the Cutholoid will automatically be captured.

Subsequent surveys of an asteroid hiding a Cutholoid will cause the science ship to go MIA unless it is cloaked.

Once the First Contact is completed, the empire will be offered a choice between the Cutholoid Hunter empire modifier or a special project that costs 2000 Engineering Research and gives a choice between the Space Fauna Ship Armor empire modifier or the Asteroidal Carapace technology.

Cutholoids come in 3 growth stages. They can be cloned using Minerals.

| Space creature | Size | Age | Reproductive status | Culling resources per rarity | Hatching time | Components | Base Hull | Base Armor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cutholoid Hatchling | 2 | 0-29y | | 30 Minerals | Time 120 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Medium Devouring Maw, Medium Meteoroid Slinger, Medium Meteoroid Slinger, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 200 | 1000 |
| Cutholoid Juvenile | 4 | 30-79y | | 60 Minerals | Time 240 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Large Devouring Maw, Large Meteoroid Slinger, Large Meteoroid Slinger, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 400 | 2600 |
| Cutholoid | 8 | 80y+ | 16 months | 120 Minerals | Time 480 | Bio-Drive, Bio-Thrusters, Bio-Sensors, Huge Devouring Maw, Large Meteoroid Slinger, Large Meteoroid Slinger, Large Meteoroid Slinger, Large Meteoroid Slinger, Regenerative Hull Tissue | 800 | 4500 |

Cloned Cutholoids will use their Devouring Maws in combat every 300 days. The weapon only affects enemies smaller than the Cutholoid and cannot target other Cutholoids. Targeted space fauna will be devoured for their resources while ships will be taken control of. Devouring Maws will always target the largest ship it can devour. The ability is lost if the Chutholoid is given a Gastric Fountain mutation.

### Capturing space fauna

Space fauna can be captured using Gravity Snares, which are unlocked by researching the technology with the same name. Gravity Snares can be launched by science ships every 80 days, requires the ship to travel to an adjacent system and cost 300 Energy and 75 Alloys per use. The success chance of each gravity snare is 10% per skill level of the science ship Scientist. If the Gravity Snare is fired from the galaxy map, it will always target the oldest space fauna in the selected system. Finishing first contact with a space fauna is necessary to use Gravity Snares on it. Each Gravity Snare will capture one space fauna, with the amount increased by one for each of the following technologies:

- Micro Singularity Enhancements
- Gravity Manipulation Optimization
- Containment System Improvement

Captured space fauna are stored in the Vivarium. Mature space fauna in the Vivarium will reproduce at regular intervals as long as there is sufficient room. Tiyanki and Voidworms require mates while Space Amoeba, Crystalline Entities and Cutholoids do not. Vivarium Capacity is capped at 200.

Captured space fauna can be culled to obtain resources and Genetic Material based on their rarity. If there is no room for newly-captured space fauna in the Vivarium, they are automatically culled.

#### Cloning

Once the Genetic Material of a space fauna species has been obtained, the space fauna can be cloned at starbases with the required modules. Cloning space fauna in the first growth stage requires the Artificial Breeding technology, cloning space fauna in the second growth stage requires the Improved Incubators technology and cloning space fauna in all growth stages requires the Metabolic Gases technology. The weapons of space fauna designs cannot be changed but they can have mutations . Core components can only be changed if the required integration technology has been researched.

Cloned space fauna have reduced upkeep if they are orbiting their preferred habitat. Tiyanki prefer Gas Giants, Space Amoeba prefer Nebulas, Crystalline Entities prefer Pulsars, Voidworms prefer Black Holes and Cutholoids prefer asteroids.

Cloned space fauna will grow just like Vivarium space fauna. Each time a cloned space fauna reaches the next growth stage, it will update to the design matching the new growth stage. Hovering over a space fauna in the fleet menu will display the remaining time until it reaches the next growth stage.

Genetic Material comes in 4 levels of rarity, which increases the stats of cloned space fauna.

| | **Common** | Rare | **Epic** | Exceptional |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Effects | | - Health +10% Hull<br>- Armor +10% Armor<br>- Shield +10% Shields<br>- +5% Damage<br>- +5% Evasion<br>- +5% Sublight Speed | - Health +20% Hull<br>- Armor +20% Armor<br>- Shield +20% Shields<br>- +10% Damage<br>- +10% Evasion<br>- +10% Sublight Speed | - Health +30% Hull<br>- Armor +30% Armor<br>- Shield +30% Shields<br>- +20% Damage<br>- +20% Evasion<br>- +15% Sublight Speed |
| Capture chance (without Containment Protocols) | 80% | 15% | 4% | 1% |
| Capture chance (with Containment Protocols) | 69.5% | 23% | 6% | 1.5% |
| Breeding result | - 89% **Common**<br>- 4% Rare<br>- 3% **Epic**<br>- 1% Exceptional | - 78% **Common**<br>- 14% Rare<br>- 6% **Epic**<br>- 2% Exceptional | - 56% **Common**<br>- 28% Rare<br>- 12% **Epic**<br>- 4% Exceptional | - 33% **Common**<br>- 35% Rare<br>- 24% **Epic**<br>- 8% Exceptional |

Empires that cloned 50 space fauna of a certain species after researching the Advanced Controlled Mutations technology will receive a special project. Completing it unlocks a mutation that can only be used on that particular space fauna species.

### Seed pods

Non-hostile space fauna fleets that feed at starbases or orbital rings with a Garden building are loaded with Seed Pods. Hovering over a space fauna fleet that carries Seed Pods on the galaxy map or selecting it shows a Seed Pods icon. Space fauna can carry the seeds from multiple Fruitful Partnership empires, in which case whose seeds make planetfall is determined at random. When a fleet with Seed Pods orbits a habitable planet, the following happens:

- If the planet is uncolonized, it gains the Dormant Seed Pods modifier and the owner of the starbase or orbital ring where the space fauna fleet fed gains an Open Seed Pods special project. The project costs 3000 Energy and takes a month to finish. Finishing it colonizes the planet. The opportunity is lost if another empire colonizes the planet.
- If the planet is colonized by another empire before or after the seeds are dropped, the colony gains 100 Pops from the founder species of the Fruitful Partnership empire and a modifier that grants colony bonuses but gives all empires with the Fruitful Partnership origin at war with the planet's owner a special project that costs 500 Energy to summon armies on the planet. The empire owning the colony gains +50 opinion with the Fruitful Partnership empire. If the two empires did not complete a First Contact, they instantly establish communications.
- If the planet is colonized by the Fruitful Partnership empire with a colony ship, it gains an 100 Pops.
- Habitable megastructures cannot be seeded.

## Ancient mining drones

Ancient Mining Drones keep to their systems until the Mid-Game year is reached, at which point they can expand. Once the First Contact is completed, the empire will be offered a choice between the Drone Destroyer empire modifier or a special project that costs 5000 Engineering Research and gives the Drone Mining Techniques empire modifier.

The Ancient Mining Drones home system contains 14 mining stations, each guarded by a fleet of 5 drones, and the Home Base Ore Grinder, which is guarded by 20 destroyers and 30 drones. Destroying the Home Base Ore Grinder grants 4000 Minerals and 500 Alloys.

- If Ancient Relics DLC is enabled, it also grants the Surveyor relic.
- If The Machine Age DLC is enabled, there is a 25% chance for the system to spawn with a Ruined Arc Furnace.

The Ancient Mining Drones use regular ship components. The Mining Drone Lasers can be reverse-engineered.

| Mining Drone | Combat Drone | Destroyer | Base |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fusion Reactor, Ion Thrusters, Radar System, Small Mining Drone Laser, Small Mining Drone Laser, Large Nanocomposite Armor, Medium Nanocomposite Armor | Fusion Reactor, Ion Thrusters, Radar System, Medium Mining Drone Laser, Small Mining Drone Laser, Small Mining Drone Laser, Large Nanocomposite Armor, Medium Nanocomposite Armor, Medium Nanocomposite Armor | Fusion Reactor, Ion Thrusters, Radar System, Medium Mining Drone Laser, Medium Mining Drone Laser, Small Mining Drone Laser, Small Mining Drone Laser, Large Nanocomposite Armor, Medium Nanocomposite Armor, Medium Nanocomposite Armor, Medium Nanocomposite Armor | Fusion Reactor, Radar System, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Scout Wing, Scout Wing, Scout Wing, Large Nanocomposite Armor, Large Nanocomposite Armor, Large Nanocomposite Armor, Large Nanocomposite Armor, Large Nanocomposite Armor |

## Void clouds

The Void Clouds never expand, beyond their starting systems. Once the First Contact is completed the empire will be offered a choice between the Cloud Destroyer empire modifier or a special project that costs 1500 Physics Research and gives the Void Loops empire modifier.

The Void Clouds home system is called Great Wound, a Black Hole cluster guarded by 3 Void Clouds. The central Black Hole contains a deposit of 10 Dark Matter.

The Cloud Lightning Conduits technology can be reverse-engineered from destroyed Void Clouds.

### VLUUR

VLUUR is a powerful migrating Void Cloud that has around 32K fleet power and is armed with 8 Cloud Lighting weapons. For as long as VLUUR is in a system, it creates a storm that causes −50% sublight speed and −15% fire rate on ships. VLUUR moves to a new system every 4-7 years.

VLUUR is not hostile but can be attacked. It has powerful shields and high evasion, but low hull, and can be defeated deceptively easily with missile weapons. Defeating VLUUR grants 100 dark matter, and creates various deposits of 1-3 dark matter on up to 4 planets in the system it is defeated in.

## Ghost Ship

The Ghost Ship is a neutral science ship which can be found patrolling the Hillos system , which is guaranteed to spawn in all games. Encountering it leads to its own First Contact, though unlike other spaceborne entities, it is the only one of its kind in the galaxy.

Surveying the Tundra World in the system uncovers the Strange Debris anomaly which, when investigated, leads to a special project which takes 360 days to complete. Researching it reveals the true nature of the Ghost Ship and rewards a moderate amount of physics research. Should the empire have gone for the Psionics tradition, it will receive extra flavor text from being able to communicate with the entity.

The Ghost Ship itself is identical to a normal science ship. If attacked, it will simply be destroyed without consequence.

## Nomads

Nomads are replaced by Caravaneers if the MegaCorp DLC is enabled.

The Nomads, or Namarians as they call themselves, are a passive millennia-old intergalactic race with no homeworld, forever traveling the void in their starships. Once they establish communications with an empire, the nomads help establish communications between any encountered empires that haven't discovered each other yet. They travel from system to system during their temporary stay in the galaxy, and eventually set sail for another galaxy. Events related to them can take place during their stay.

The date when and if the Nomads arrive is determined at game start, with the following chances per human player:

- 20% chance to appear after 7,300 to 7,800 days (roughly 20.28 to 21.67 years)
- 25% chance to appear after 14,600 to 15,100 days (roughly 40.56 to 41.94 years)
- 25% chance to appear after 20,075 to 20,575 days (roughly 55.76 to 57.15 years)
- 30% chance to not trigger (they may still appear if another human player rolls them)

If more than one player triggers the Nomads, they spawn a single time on the earliest date.

When they arrive, the Nomads spawn in a random non-hostile rim system that no regular empire has more than low intel on. Upon appearing, they decide the midpoint and endpoint systems of their journey.

- Midpoint: A random non-hostile system with a distance of 250 to 500 from their starting system. If no such system exists, they choose a system with a distance of 150 to 500, whether or not it's hostile.
- Endpoint: A random rim system with a distance of 400 to 1450 from their starting system. If no such system exists, they choose a system with a distance of 250 to 1450.

On their journey, Nomads perform an action on entering a system. Those actions depends on if the system has an owner and what their relationship with the owner is. If the system is owned by an empire they haven't contacted and isn't hostile to them, they start orbiting a random planet in the system until contact is established. The system owner is unable to decipher their communications, but contact is always established after 100 days. After contact is established, they send the owner a request. If they enter another system owned by the same empire, they roll for a request again. Each interaction has the following chances:

- **30%** – Ask to leave some pops on an owned planet within the empire's borders. If the empire agrees, 300 Egalitarian Namarian pops spawn on a random Arid, Desert, or Savannah colony. A colony is 6 times as likely to be chosen if it has more than 0 free housing and 11 times as likely to be chosen if it has more than 1 free housing. Namarians are immortal and have the Desert Preference, Nomadic, Venerable, and Natural Engineers traits. If the Grand Archive DLC is installed this will give the Namarian Sculpture specimen.
 - ×0 If the system owner does not have a colony on a Dry planet
 - ×0 If the system owner is a Hive Mind
 - ×0.75 If they've already left pops with the system owner
 - ×1.5 If they haven't left pops with the system owner yet and the system owner is some degree of Xenophile, Egalitarian, or Spiritualist
 - ×0.3 If the system owner's slavery policy is set to Allowed

- **30%** – Ask for an uncolonized planet to colonize, forming a new empire. If the empire agrees, they gain 150 to 300 influence and a random uncolonized Arid, Desert, Tropical, Ocean, or Gaia world within their borders becomes the capital of a new single-system Namarian empire. The new empire has Democratic authority, the Egalitarian, Spiritualist, and Xenophile ethics, random civics, and a decaying +100 opinion modifier towards the empire. The new empire starts with 1400 Egalitarian Namarian pops that have their climate preference trait changed to match their new planet, 1000 energy and minerals, and 500 influence. If the Grand Archive DLC is installed this will give the Namarian Colonist Standard specimen.
 - ×0 If the system owner doesn't control an uncolonized Tundra, Arid, Desert, Tropical, Continental, or Gaia world in an uninhabited system.
 - ×0 If the system owner is a Hive Mind
 - ×0.5 If they've already colonized a planet from any empire
 - ×1.75 If they haven't colonized a planet yet and the system owner is some degree of Xenophile, Egalitarian, or Spiritualist

- **30%** – Sell 5 or 15 Cruisers. If the Grand Archive DLC is installed this will give the Namarian Vessel Heraldry specimen.
 - ×0 If the system owner already was offered ships
 - ×0.25 If the system owner is Fanatic Militarist or Fanatic Xenophobe
 - ×0.5 If they already sold ships to an empire
 - ×1.75 If they haven't sold ships to anyone yet and the system owner is some degree of Xenophile, Egalitarian, or Spiritualist

- **10%** – Move on with no request.

If the system has no owner, isn't hostile, and isn't the mid- or endpoint of their journey, they perform a peaceful action with the following chances:

- **10%** – Repair fleet and build new ships.
 - ×10 If under 3k Fleet Power
 - ×5 If under 5k Fleet Power
 - ×0 If over 10k Fleet Power or have built new ships within the last 120 days

- **80%** – Pick a random planet and wait in orbit for 40–50 days. Afterwards, they have a 25% chance to move on and 75% chance to pick another planet in the system to orbit. They orbit a maximum of three planets this way before moving on.
 - ×0 If less than 1.5k Fleet Power

- **10%** – Move on without doing anything.

While the Nomads are inherently peaceful, a fight can be picked in order to get access to their technology. Nomads are easy prey but their technology is just average by midgame, making this rarely useful. The nomad fleet consists of the following:

| 20 Protectors | 3 Ark Ships |
|---|---|
| Hyper Drive III, Antimatter Reactor, Plasma Thrusters, Subspace Sensors, Advanced Combat Computer (Picket), Large X-Ray Laser, Barrier Point-Defense, Barrier Point-Defense, Medium Plasteel Armor, Medium Plasteel Armor, Medium Shields | Hyper Drive III, Antimatter Reactor, Plasma Thrusters, Subspace Sensors |

## Enigmatic Cache

The Enigmatic Cache, or BALDOR as it calls itself, is a tubular entity that emerges from any Gateway or L-Gate once the mid-game year is reached, if any player empire is at peace, and sets course for the nearest empire that is not at war. Upon being attacked it instantly teleports away to the closest system with a Gateway or L-Gate.

Once the Enigmatic Cache enters an empire's borders, it starts orbiting each one of the empire's colonies for a decade. As long as it orbits a colony, it gives a +30% research from jobs modifier to the colony, but also −10% happiness to any pops with the Xenophobe ethic. The first time the Enigmatic Cache orbits an empire's colony, the empire receives the option of issuing a special project to study it or leave it alone and gain 50 influence. The special project costs 2500 engineering research, and finishing it refunds 18x engineering output ( 350~100 000 ) and grants an L-Gate insight, if the empire has discovered an L-Gate. Once all colonies have been scanned, the Enigmatic Cache sets course for the nearest empire and repeats the process.

After all colonies in the galaxy have been scanned, the Enigmatic Cache goes to the capital of a biological empire that did not attack it and does not have the Wilderness origin and requests to uplift the founder species via a special project that takes 2 years. In multiplayer, the human player with the lowest Relative Power is chosen, random if tied. In singleplayer, the player empire is always chosen. If the founder species doesn't have the Intelligent, Quick Learners. Erudite or Augmented Intelligence traits, 60 to 80 days into the project there is a 50% chance to be given the choice between aborting the uplift or adding the Fatigued modifier ( −30% resources from jobs) all founder Specialist pops. The modifier lasts until the uplift process is completed or aborted. 130 to 170 days into the project, the empire is notified that the Enigmatic Cache is deteriorating. Some founder Specialist pops gain the Vegetable modifier ( −80% resources from jobs) until the uplift is completed or aborted, and the player is offered the following options:

- Abort the uplift, causing the Enigmatic Cache to teleport away and never return.
- Ignore it. Once the project is complete, the 400 pops gain the Unlifted trait, all other biological founder species pops gain the Somewhat Uplifted trait, and all of them gain the PTSD modifier ( −20% happiness) for 10 years. The Enigmatic Cache remains in orbit above the capital and permanently gives its research from jobs modifier.
- Issue a special project to repair the Enigmatic Cache with a construction ship. Once the uplift is complete, if the repair project was finished, the founder species gains the Uplifted trait and lose the Slow Learners trait if they have it. The Enigmatic Cache also remains in orbit above the capital and permanently gives its research from jobs modifier.
- If the founder species has the Erudite trait, Uplifted will not be added as it is incompatible.

## Abandoned hatchery invaders

The abandoned hatchery invaders will be present in the galaxy if at least one empire has the Starlit Citadel origin. Their system will not have any hyperlane connection but will contain a portal linked to 2-10 wormholes throughout the galaxy, depending on galaxy size. All these wormholes connect to the portal, and the portal can be used to travel to any of the connected wormholes. All empires with the Starlit Citadel origin will start with a wormhole leading to the abandoned hatchery as well.

The abandoned hatchery system contains a random habitable world with the Ruined Hatchery blocker. The black hole has a deposit of 3 Living Metal. Other celestial bodies in the system will have randomized amounts of Food, Society or Exotic Gases.

Every 5-10 years the abandoned hatchery will build a fleet of Maulers and Weavers and attack any empire with the Starlit Citadel origin. The number of ships and their stats increase with each attack. The abandoned hatchery is protected by a fleet but its biological ships will not grow. The abandoned hatchery invaders use the following components:

| Juvenile Mauler | Juvenile Weaver | Starbase |
|---|---|---|
| Bio-Hyperlane Field, Fission Metabolism, Chemical Stellar Motor Organs, Radiolocation, Neural Implants (Swarm), Metabolic Recycler, Combat Mandibles, Small Quill Battery, Small Nanocomposite Carapace, Small Nanocomposite Carapace | Bio-Hyperlane Field, Fission Metabolism, Chemical Stellar Motor Organs, Radiolocation, Neural Implants (Swarm), Basic Symbiotic Amplifier, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Spore Launcher, Spore Launcher, Small Nanocomposite Carapace, Small Nanocomposite Carapace, Small Nanocomposite Carapace, Small Nanocomposite Carapace, Small Nanocomposite Carapace, Small Nanocomposite Carapace | Radiolocation, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Medium Bio-Plasma Thrower, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Large Plasteel Carapace, Reactor Booster |

When the abandoned hatchery invaders are defeated all empires with the Starlit Citadel origin (except the one that defeated them, if any) will gain +10% Happiness and Pop growth or assembly speed for 5 years.

If the abandoned hatchery invaders are defeated by an Individualist empire with the Starlit Citadel origin, it will receive the following for 10 years:

- +10% Pop growth or assembly speed
- +10% Monthly Unity
- +20% Happiness
- A special project to unlock the Warden of the Citadel council position and gain scaled Society Research

If the abandoned hatchery invaders are defeated by a Gestalt Consciousness empire with the Starlit Citadel origin, it will receive the following for 10 years:

- +10% Pop growth or assembly speed
- +10% Monthly Unity
- A special project to gain the Siege Node permanent empire modifier and scaled Society Research and the Cognitive Node will gain or upgrade the Expertise: Military Theory trait
