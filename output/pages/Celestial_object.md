# Celestial object

**Celestial objects** are large bodies within systems, including stars, planets, moons, and asteroids. Celestial objects may have resources which can be harvested by orbital stations . Each start system can have between 2 and 15 celestial objects.

When any owned ship enters a system or passes within its sensor range, any habitable planets in the system will be revealed along with their world type. To see further details about the celestial objects in a system, it is necessary to survey them with a science ship. This will reveal all of the orbital resources associated with each planet or asteroid. For habitable worlds, this will also reveal more detailed world information including: size, available districts, planetary features and blockers (if any), and the habitability for each species in the player's empire. Additionally, surveying worlds has a chance to reveal anomalies .

## Planet size

The planet size determines the visual size of a planet and the maximum number of districts the planet can support if it's habitable. Planets can have various sizes, but habitable ones will always be within the following margins:

- Planets have a size between 12 and 25.
- Moons have a size between 10 and 15.
- Homeworlds have a size between 18 and 21, unless otherwise determined by the empire's origin .

## Habitable planets

Habitable planets are the only natural celestial objects that can be colonized and terraformed , without the Terraforming Candidate planet modifier.

There are nine types of regular habitable planets, divided equally into three climate categories: Wet, Dry, and Cold. Each type's base habitability for a given species depends on how closely it matches a species' homeworld: in general, a species will have 100% habitability for its homeworld, 80% habitability for planets of the same type, 60% habitability for planets of the same climate category, and 20% habitability for every other climate category and type. Finally, these habitability values can be both increased and decreased species-wide by certain traits and for a given planet by certain planetary features and planetary modifiers.

A planet's type also affects the set of possible planetary features and blockers it may have. Each of the three climate categories has a slight bias towards different resources from their planetary features.

Volcanic Worlds can only appear if the Infernals DLC is installed. Their Alloys from jobs output is increased by +5% and they use a different set of districts.

| Type | Climate | Favored features |
|---|---|---|
| **Desert** Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Precipitation and major bodies of surface water are relatively rare. Significant temperature variations between day and night cycles. Vegetation is scarce, but even moderate precipitation can make the desert bloom. | Dry | Generator features |
| **Arid** Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce. | | |
| **Savanna** Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases. | | |
| **Ocean** Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans cover more than 90% of the surface, with scattered islands making up the remaining percentage. | Wet | Agriculture features |
| **Continental** Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation. | | |
| **Tropical** Humid, rocky world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation. | | |
| **Arctic** Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the planet experiences seasonal variations and the equatorial band is covered by vegetation. | Cold | Mining features |
| **Alpine** Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences the minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation. | | |
| **Tundra** Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens. | | |
| **Volcanic** Rocky world with a sulfur rich atmosphere and a partially liquid lithosphere. The ash and basalt covered surface is interspersed with fresh volcanic activity, lava lakes and rivers. Only extremophile life forms can be found, if any. | Volcanic | Yes Any |

### Special habitable planets

Special habitable planets are only spawned in certain systems, but any empire that meets the requirements can terraform a regular habitable world into a special one. Certain origins use one of these as the empire's homeworld. All of them have either very high or zero habitability, and several of them feature "ideal" habitability, meaning that they have 100% base habitability for all species.

Those planets have the Terraforming Candidate modifier. |

### Habitable megastructures

Habitable megastructures are artificial celestial objects and can be constructed using resources after researching the required technology. They feature the same Habitability for every species and have different districts and designations . They do not normally have any planetary features on them but may contain blockers. Their appearance depends on the ship appearance of the empire that constructed them.

| Type | Habitability | Size | Effects | Construction methods | Preexisting worlds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ring World** An immense band encircling the system's sun. Built to allow for numerous artificial habitation zones along its inner span, freed from the restrictions and mundanity of planet-bound, spherical existence. | Ideal | 10 | +50% Automatic resettlement destination chance | - Mega-Engineering technology to repair broken fragments or restore Shattered Ring Worlds<br>- Ring World technology to construct from scratch | - Unknown Sanctuary system<br>- Ancient Caretakers home system |

This section of the megastructure has sustained damage - especially to some of its more advanced districts - but it does not appear irreparable. | Ideal | 25 | Enables the Repair the Shattered Ring decision | No | Shattered Ring home system |
| **Orbital Habitat** An artificial deep-space arcology offering planet-like - if decidedly urban - living conditions. Hydroponics and advanced filtering technologies make it near-self-sustaining, and station-borne facilities can mine the station's host planet for raw materials. | - 40% at tier I<br>- 50% at tier II<br>- 60% at tier III | 6 | - Yes Comes in three tiers shown in the outliner<br>- +200% Colony development speed | Orbital Habitats technology | - Void Dwellers home system<br>- Knights of the Toxic God home system<br>- Unknown A few unique systems |

## Uninhabitable planets

All non-star celestial objects that cannot harbor life are classified as uninhabitable. These planets cannot be colonized or terraformed unless they have the Terraforming Candidate modifier, but they can have various resource deposits.

| Type | Deposits | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | Other | |
| **Barren (Dry)** Barren and rocky world with a thin or non-existent atmosphere. The surface is covered in meteor impact craters and is completely devoid of life. | | | | | |
| **Barren (Cold)** Barren and rocky world with a thin or non-existent atmosphere. The surface is covered in meteor impact craters and is completely devoid of life. | | | | | |
| **Broken** World devastated by some catastrophic event. Whatever properties it may once have had are no longer discernable. | | | | | |
| **Frozen** Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere preclude the existence of life on the surface. | | | | | |
| **Gas Giant** Gaseous planet with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium surrounding a dense core. | | | | | |
| **Molten** Rocky world that is scorching hot. The atmosphere is thin or non-existent, and lava from the interior flows freely due to constant volcanic eruptions. This type of planet cannot sustain organic life. | | | | | |
| **Toxic** A rocky planet with a thick atmosphere that is lethal to all known higher forms of life. | | | | | |

### Special uninhabitable planets

Special uninhabitable planets can only be created in unique systems or as a result of events.

| Type | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AI** Rocky world covered with artificial structures. The thin atmosphere consists mostly of industrial pollutants. There are strong energy emissions coming from across the entire surface, but no organic life signs. | - Unique planets are created by the Contingency<br>- Successful bombardment turns the planet into a broken world. |
| **Infested** The surface of this world is covered by some kind of biological contaminant. | - Created when habitable worlds are infested by the Prethoryn Swarm<br>- Successful bombardment turns the planet into a barren world that can be terraformed |
| **Shattered** The charred, broken remnants of what was once a planet. A massive energy surge has detonated this world's core, leaving only slabs of rock. | - Created when planets are consumed by Terravore empires<br>- Created when planets are destroyed with a World Cracker colossus weapon<br>- All worlds will have a deposit of 4-16 Minerals<br>- Enables the system's starbase to construct the Mining Bay building |
| **Shielded** This entire world is encased in some kind of impenetrable energy barrier. It blocks all scans of the surface. | - Created when planets are shielded with a Global Pacifier colossus weapon<br>- Found through exploration, where the shield can be brought down through a special project with different possible outcomes |
| **Shrouded** Our sensors are unable to penetrate the thick fog surrounding the planet. Ships that enter it do not return. | - Created by the Teachers of the Shroud origin<br>- Created by the Eater of Worlds and End of the Cycle<br>- Created by the The Reckoning<br>- Also found in some special systems |
| **Cracked** The cracked shards of an enormous planet-sized egg. | - Created by the hatching of the Voidspawn, destroying the existing colony<br>- Has a deposit of 20 Society |
| **Junk Moon** A large body of magnetized space junk composed of scrap metal, satellite remains, and recaptured megastructure parts. | - Created by an event<br>- Has a deposit of 10 Alloys and 3 Minerals |

## Asteroid belts

Asteroid belts can only appear in systems with a single star or special systems. Each single star system has a 30% chance to have an asteroid belt, a 10% chance to have two asteroid belts and a 2% chance to have four asteroid belts. Each asteroid belt will have 1-6 asteroid celestial objects, partially depending on distance from the star. Asteroid belts and the asteroids in them come in 3 types.

- Each asteroid can have deposits of Trade Value.
- Rocky asteroids can have deposits of Minerals, Alloys or Volatile Motes.
- Ice asteroids can have deposits of Energy or Exotic Gases.
- Crystalline asteroids can only appear in special systems and have deposits of 1 or 3 Rare Crystals. They can also be found in the home system of empires with the Cosmic Dawn origin but these can only have deposits of Minerals.

Asteroids are surveyed twice as fast as other celestial objects (15 days instead of 30).

## Stars

A star is a celestial object that composes the center of a star system and influences the generation of the solar system. They are classified based on their spectral characteristics . Less common stars also have a negative effect on all ships in the system, making certain tactics less effective in battle. Different stars have different likelihoods for habitable planets to appear in the system.

Most solar systems are unary systems with only one star, but they can also exist as binary systems with two stars or trinary systems with three stars, either orbiting each other in the center with all planets around them or spread out further apart from each with a few planets orbiting each star. Star effects stack in binary and trinary systems. All binary and trinary systems except for F/M, B/M, B/neutron and A/neutron (which cannot spawn habitable planets) have 100% habitable planet chance. All natural systems have 4-10 (inclusive) orbiting objects, except single neutron stars, black holes and pulsars (which have 1-4).

| Type | Potential resources | Habitable planet chance | Effects | Possible megastructures |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Class B** The large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them among the most visible to the naked eye. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 40% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class A** These relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 40% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class F** F-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarves. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 100% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class G** Often referred to as yellow dwarves, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 100% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class K** These main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarves, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 100% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class M** The most common stars in the universe, often referred to as red dwarves. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarves emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 30% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class M Red Giant** With a large radius and comparatively low surface temperature, red giants are stars of moderate mass in a late stage of stellar evolution. Their expanded stellar atmosphere and high luminosity make for distant habitable zone orbits. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 7.5% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class T Brown Dwarf** Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that lack the mass to sustain hydrogen fusion. Roughly the size of large gas giants, they have a much greater density. Their low luminosity and comparatively small heat generation means that planets orbiting them are unlikely to support life. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 30% | Can only appear in binary and trinary systems | |
| **Neutron Star** These incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star. The gravitational waves and radiation emitted by Neutron Stars must be carefully navigated around, slowing the sublight speed of ships. | - Engineering<br>- Physics | 0% | - 50% Sublight Speed Reduction<br>- Allows construction of a Quantum Catapult | - Ring World<br>- Quantum Catapult |
| **Pulsar** Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy. The radiation emitted by pulsars interferes with deflector technology, rendering ship and station shields inoperable. | - Engineering<br>- Physics | 0% | - 100% Shield Nullification<br>- Allows construction of a Quantum Catapult | - Ring World<br>- Quantum Catapult |
| **Black Hole** Typically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed. The gravitational waves emitted by black holes interfere with FTL drives, making it harder for ships to escape from combat. | - Engineering<br>- Physics<br>- Dark Matter | 0% | - 50% Disengagement Chance Reduction<br>- +50% Emergency FTL Jump Cooldown<br>- Unlocks the Black Hole Observatory starbase building<br>- Allows construction of a Matter Decompressor<br>- No Cannot have gas giants in orbit | Matter Decompressor |
| **Viridescent Lightbringer** Millennia of exposure to the Toxic Entity have caused alterations in the makeup of this star. Though once it was a fairly standard G-type star, now it emits an eerie green haze unlike anything seen elsewhere in the galaxy. | - Volatile Motes<br>- Exotic Gases | 0% | - 100% Armor Nullification<br>- Unique to the system created at the completion of the Quest for the Toxic God situation | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Astral Star** In place of a star, the celestial objects in this system orbit an ancient Astral Rift. | Astral Threads | 0% | Unique to the azilash system . | - Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard |

## Astral scars

Astral scars are celestial objects that appear at the edge of systems. At the beginning of the game 10% of the systems will contain an astral scar and each one will have a deposit of 2 Astral Threads. After the mid-game year is reached, each year there is a small chance for new astral scars to appear and for existing ones to become an astral rift . If the system is owned by an empire, it will be notified. New astral scars will have a deposit of 1 Astral Threads. Astral scars are twice more likely to appear in systems with multiple stars and thrice more likely to appear in nebulae. They cannot appear if an adjacent system has an astral scar or astral rift.
