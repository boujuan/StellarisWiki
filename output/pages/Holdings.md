# Holdings

A holding represents an area on a world that is owned by an empire other than the world's owner. There are two type of holdings: overlord holdings and branch offices. Both of them provide vision in the system where they're built. Only one of each holding can be constructed on a world. The construction speed of holdings is affected by the system owner's construction speed bonuses and penalties rather than those of the holding owner.

## Overlord holdings

Overlord holdings can be constructed by overlords on their subjects' worlds. The total number of holdings that can be constructed anywhere within a subject's empire is determined by the Holdings Limit term in the subject agreement and is also affected by the Bureaucratic Surveillance resolutions. Overlord holdings can be distributed across multiple worlds, or all constructed together on a single world. If built from the Subject Agreement menu, they are built on the subject's capital by default.

If a subject becomes independent, all overlord holdings are destroyed.

## Branch offices

Branch offices can be constructed by empires with Corporate authority. They give the corporate empire Trade equal to 50% of the world's current Trade. Only one branch office can be established on each world, by any empire. They cannot be constructed on Nanite Worlds, or systems owned by a Gestalt Consciousness, Fanatic Purifiers or fallen empire. Branch offices can be closed by their corporate owner at any time.

Establishing a branch office costs a base of 1000 energy credits and 50 influence increasing by 10% for each hyperlane jump after 3 jumps, and increases the corporate empire's empire size by 5. The establishment cost can be reduced by −15% with the Universal Transactions ascension perk.

Up to four branch office buildings can be built in a branch office, with each level of capital tier unlocking one corporate building slot. Branch office buildings provide various jobs to the planet and bonuses to the corporate empire, adding 1% to resources and Naval Capacity produced by branch office buildings per 1 Trade gained by Branch Office, as well as increase the planet's Trade based on the corporate building and the jobs filled on the planet. The Influence cost of corporate buildings is doubled if the world's owner has Corporate authority.

Branch offices can be created by corporations that have any of the following with the system's owner:

- Commercial Pact
- Federation
- Subject
- Overlord
- Same overlord unless overlord has Corporate authority or the Corporate Sovereign civic
- Corporate Sovereign civic and the system owner is a member of the Galactic Imperium
- Imperial Charter resolution and the system owner is a member of the Galactic Imperium
- Commercial Agreement and the pre-FTL civilization reached Atomic Age or Early Space Age

If the Corporate empire loses the last relationship that allowed it to establish a branch office, the branch office remains open, but the world's owner gains the Expropriation casus belli.

Many Corporate civics either unlock a civic corporate building or grant additional bonuses to a specific building, causing it to increase the Trade output of certain jobs on the planet and add +200 Trader jobs to the corporate empire's capital. The bonuses stack if multiple civics improve the same corporate building.

Empires with the Criminal Heritage civic have much more relaxed requirements to establish a branch office and their Trade output ranges from 25% to 75% of the world's current Trade depending on the amount of Crime present on the world. If they do not meet the regular requirements for a legal branch office, they instead use an "illegal" set of corporate buildings that shift half of the produced jobs to Criminal jobs and produce +25 Crime. Additionally, the system owner will gain the Expropriation casus belli and there is a 5% chance monthly that the branch office will be closed while the planet has no Crime. The empire cannot have another branch office closed for 10 years, but the branch office cannot be re-established on the same world for 10 years either. Criminal Heritage empires also cannot establish a branch office when they are at war or have a truce with the system owner. Each legal corporate building increases the minimum amount of Crime on the planet by +5 as well. Legal and illegal corporate building convert if the empire meets or no longer meets the requirements to have a legal branch office.
