# Warfare

As long as there is at least one empire present that is not Fanatic Pacifist, **war** is an almost inevitable aspect in any game and can be anything from a small border skirmish to a massive interstellar war of conquest. Wars are how mid-game and end-game borders are usually drawn. Each belligerent states a war goal of a predetermined "Surrender acceptance" cost; achieving it through imposing war exhaustion, system occupation and relative fleet size. Wars may end with neither side achieving their goal.

Depending on diplomatic agreements, wars may have more than one empire on either side. In that case the empire that declared war and the empire that was declared war upon will be designated war leaders. Only war leaders can offer or accept surrenders or status quos. If an empire is part of a Federation the requirements to be able to declare war depend on the War Declaration federation law, and if an empire is an overlord then its subjects may or may not join the war depending on the Overlord Conflicts terms.

When an AI empire is about to declare war, it will first move fleets towards the border of the target. Targeted empires that have any military intel on the aggressor will receive a warning, with higher military intel levels providing a more accurate estimate on when war will be declared. AI allies in a war will occasionally send their fleets to follow the fleets of the war leader.

## Casus belli and wargoals

In order for an empire to start a war, it needs a Casus Belli – a reason to declare war. Each casus belli grants access to at least one type of wargoal, which represents the purpose of the war. Once a war is declared, the attacked empire has a year to choose its wargoals.

All wars, regardless of wargoals, has the following common effects, triggered before any other effects:

- Status quo effect: Each side keeps all systems they have fully occupied if they have claims on them. This excludes the defender's capital, in case of status quo the defender will retain its capital system regardless of occupation.
- Victory effect: Winner gain control of all systems with claims from the loser, even if not occupied. All systems occupied by the loser are returned, regardless of claims.

Surrender acceptance modified by −10 per unoccupied claimed system, and −100 per unoccupied claimed colonized system.

| Casus belli and wargoals | Requirements | Surrender acceptance value | Victory effect | Status quo effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|

If the winner has the Shared Burdens or Crusader Spirit civics and the loser does not, they gain them. If the loser has the Shared Burdens or Crusader Spirit civic while the winner does not they lose them. If the loser has a sovereign civic it gets removed. | If at least 1 colonized system is fully occupied, then all systems fully occupied by the attacker will be turned into an empire with the attacker's ethics and the Liberated origin. |

If the loser had the Cosmogenesis ascension perk it also gains −50% research speed for 10 years. | |

### Subjugation CBs

Subjugation CBs seek to end the independence of the targeted empire. If it has any subjects, the effects will apply to them as well. And if the loser is part of a Federation, it will leave it. Subjugation CBs cannot be used if all systems of the targeted empire are already claimed or against a fallen empire, the Custodian or the Galactic Emperor. All of them have a surrender acceptance of −100 . Using them for a Proxy War costs 200 Influence.

In case of a status quo, if at least 1 colonized system is fully occupied then all systems fully occupied will be turned into a new empire with the Liberated origin and the victory conditions will be imposed upon it.

| Casus belli and wargoals | Requirements | Victory subjugation |
|---|---|---|
| - **Subjugation**<br>  - Vassalize<br>  - Make Tributary<br>  - Make Subsidiary | Superior relative power to the target empire.<br>- No Driven Assimilator<br>- No Devouring Swarm<br>- No Fanatic Purifiers and not same species<br>- No Determined Exterminator and not machine species | Subject (initial terms of agreement and Loyalty depend on the Subjugation War Terms policy) |
| - **Hegemon**<br>  - Establish Hegemony | President of a level 3+ Hegemony federation<br>- No Target is not in federation | Hegemony member |
| - **Scion**<br>  - Bring Into Fold | Scion origin | Scion of the same overlord |
| - **Imposed Inclusion**<br>  - Bring Into Fold | - Galactic Nemesis ascension perk<br>- No Genocidal | Subject (initial terms of agreement and Loyalty depend on the Subjugation War Terms policy) |
| - **Imperial Crusade**<br>  - Force Into Imperium | Imperial Crusade resolution | Galactic Imperium member |

### Paired CBs

The following CBs are paired together. If an empire starts a war with either of the paired CBs, the defender will automatically use the other casus belli and cannot pick another one.

| Casus belli and wargoal 1 | Casus belli and wargoal 2 | Requirements | Victory effect | Status quo effect | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Subject**<br>- Independence | **Subject**<br>- Assert Overlordship | - Subject and overlord<br>- Subject not in a federation with overlord | If the subject wins, it becomes independent and the former overlord loses all claims on the former subject's systems. | The subject becomes independent and the former overlord gains claims on the former subject's systems. | |
| **Secession**<br>- Leave Hegemony | **Secession**<br>- Assert Hegemony | - President refused member to leave federation<br>- No Federation is at war | If the attacker wins, it leaves the federation and the president loses all claims on the former member's systems. If the president wins, both empires gain a temporary −20 opinion towards each other. | The attacker leaves the federation and the president gains claims on the former member's systems. | All empires that have the same casus belli as part of the same federation can be invited as attackers. |
| **Allegiance War**<br>- Secret Fealty | **Allegiance War**<br>- Maintain Servitude | Secret Fealty from one of target's subjects | If the attackers win, all empires that pledged Secret Fealty to the main attacker will become the attacker's subjects and gain +2.5 Monthly Loyalty for 10 years. If the defender wins, the attacking subjects will gain +5 Monthly Loyalty for 5 years and cannot pledge Secret Fealty during that time. | The subject cannot pledge Secret Fealty for 5 years. | All empires which swore secret fealty to the attacker will join the attacker's side. |
| **Imperium**<br>- Restore Community | **Imperium**<br>- Crush the Rebellion | - Imperium: Spark Rebellion operation | Losers gain −60% Diplomatic Weight for 6 years. If the attackers win, the Galactic Imperium becomes the Galactic Community again. If the defenders win, the Galactic Imperium gains 100 Imperial Authority. | All attackers leave the Galactic Imperium and form a federation. | |
| **Imperial Rebuke**<br>- Imperial Rebuke | **Animosity**<br>- Humiliate | - Rivalry<br>- Galactic Emperor | Gain 100 Influence. Loser loses all of its Influence, gains −33% monthly influence gain and −10% happiness for 10 years. If the loser had the Supremacist Diplomatic Stance policy, it is changed to Belligerent. If the defenders win, the Galactic Imperium loses 25 Imperial Authority. | | |

#### Total War

Certain paired CBs have as objective the complete destruction of the opposing empire will cause a Total War. In Total Wars all occupied systems automatically change ownership. Their new owner will be the participant with the highest claim count on it or the nearest war participant if none of them claim the system. In case of a status quo each side keeps all conquered systems.

During a Total War surrender is not possible - the war continues until either one side is fully conquered or a status quo. If a defeated empire had starbases in uncolonized systems that were not conquered, they are removed, making the territory neutral again.

Proxy War with a Total War casus belli costs 200 Influence.

## Claims

While casus belli and wargoals represent the purpose of a war, **claims** represent territorial ambitions — the systems which will be controlled by the victor. Which systems can be claimed depends on an empire's War Philosophy policy, with the Unrestricted Warfare philosophy allowing for the claiming of any system not owned by a fellow Federation member. It is possible to claim the same system multiple times to gain a stronger claim on it, which can outbid the competing claims of allies when going to war together. If multiple empires have the same number of claims on a system, the oldest claim is considered the strongest. In general, claims are expensive in the early game and become less so later on to allow for more decisive wars to be fought. Claims cannot be rescinded while at war.

Claims have a base cost of 50 influence, modified by the following:

- +25 per hyperlane distance from owned territory
- +25 if the system has an upgraded Starbase (i.e. not just an Outpost)
- +25 if the system is colonized
- All costs are increased by +100% during an offensive war
- All costs are reduced by −20% if the claimed system belongs to a Rival

If the modifier reaches a total of −100% , claims then cost 0 influence.

Defenders can freely claim systems owned by their attackers in a defensive war regardless of their War Philosophy policy. Any system lost by any side during a conquest war or total war will give the former owner 10 claims on it.

Winning war with any wargoals, Conquer or not, will always enforce all claims made by the victorious empires before any other effects, regardless of whether these systems were occupied. For example, an empire winning a war with the Subjugation casus belli will annex all claimed systems from the loser before making a Vassal of the loser's remaining systems. Therefore, if enforcing all claims would lead to the destruction of the target empire, casus belli like Ideology and Subjugation will become unavailable. The Claim casus belli instead benefits a reduced threat generation.

## Ending wars

Wars can end in two ways: With the surrender of either side or with a negotiated Status Quo peace.

**Surrender** means that the victor's wargoal is enforced; any claims the winning side has on the losing side are automatically ceded regardless of occupation status and the defeated empire is forced to keep borders open towards the attacker for 10 years. All wars except those of independence have a negative surrender acceptance, which are countered by factors such as relative navy strength (up to +50 toward surrender cost), war exhaustion (up to +100 toward surrender cost) and occupation percentage (up to +100 toward surrender cost). If an empire and all of its allies (if any) has lost control of all of its systems and/or planets during the war, then a surrender will occur automatically.

**Status Quo** means that the war has reached a point where neither side is able to score a decisive victory against the other or all wargoals have been achieved decisively before any major battles took place, and both sides agree to cease hostilities and settle for whatever gains or losses they have acquired/suffered. Under a Status Quo peace, all **fully** occupied systems claimed by a belligerent empire are ceded to the belligerent with the strongest claim. In the case of a tie, whoever has the oldest claim on the system is considered the stronger claimant. In addition both sides must keep their borders open towards each other for 10 years. Since AI won't surrender to a Total War, they can end only in Status Quo or the destruction of one empire. Status Quo can be enforced by either side as soon as 24 months have passed since the opposing side reached 100% war exhaustion, and if both sides reach 100% war exhaustion, the Status Quo is enforced automatically after 24 months.

### War exhaustion

War Exhaustion goes from 0% to 100%, and measures the total weariness and attrition suffered by all empires on one side in a war. War exhaustion goes up from suffering losses during space and ground warfare, destruction of planets (either from Colossus weapons or Armageddon Bombardment), and a passive accumulation over time called Attrition. When a side's war exhaustion hits 100% they can be forced into a status quo peace after 24 months. The speed at which war exhaustion accumulates is influenced by factors such as ethics, traditions, technology and the amount of claims being pressed - an empire that is fighting to hold onto a handful of border systems will tire faster in a costly conflict than one whose very independence is being threatened. War exhaustion also means that an empire that is losing a war can still fight to minimize their territorial losses by inflicting high war exhaustion on the enemy.

War exhaustion gain can be lowered by the following factors: If these modifiers add up to −100% , then no War exhaustion will ever be accumulated.

| War exhaustion gain 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Relentless Aggression crisis perk ( Level 2) | −75% |
| Never Surrender tradition | −25% |
| Gestalt Consciousness ethic | −20% |
| Nationalistic Zeal civic | −20% |
| Supremacist diplomatic stance | −20% |
| Demobilization Initiative resolution (5) | −20% |
| Last Resort Doctrine resolution (4) | −15% |
| Independent Tribunals resolution (3) | −10% |
| Belligerent diplomatic stance | −10% |
| Interstellar Campaigns technology | −10% |
| Galactic Campaigns technology | −10% |
| Media Conglomerate civic | −5% |
| Display of Power agenda | −5% |
| Impenetrable Border agenda | −5% |
| Military Buildup agenda | −5% |
| Reverence for Life resolution (2) | −5% |

## Proxy wars

Empires with the Secret Societies civic can start wars between other other empires as long as all empires have completed First Contact with each other. Starting a Proxy War requires either 70 Trust or 60 Infiltration with the empire declaring the Proxy War. Proxy Wars can use any casus belli unlocked by the empire declaring war as well as the Proxy War casus belli. Multiple empires can be invited to join the attacker side as long as the requirements are met with each empire. Empires that are Fanatic Xenophobe, Barbaric Despoilers, Criminal Heritage, Driven Assimilator, Bodysnatcher or Genocidal cannot be made to start a Proxy War.

Starting a Proxy War costs Influence and either Infiltration or Trust depending on which one is used.

- Claims and Proxy War costs 90 Influence and 30 Infiltration or Trust
- Subjugation CBs and well as CBs that start a Total War cost 150 Influence and 50 Infiltration or Trust
- Other CBs cost 80 Influence and 25 Infiltration or Trust

For every attacker invited in the proxy war there is a 10% chance that the reason for the war is discovered. If it is discovered, every empire on either side of the war will lose a temporary −200 Opinion with the empire that started the proxy war. If the empire that started the proxy war joined the Galactic Community it will also receive −20% Diplomatic Weight for 10 years.

If the Nemesis DLC is also installed, empires that finish the Subterfuge tradition tree also gain the ability to start a Proxy War but the cost is increased by 25%.
