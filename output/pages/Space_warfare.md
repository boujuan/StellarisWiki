# Space warfare

Most warfare is settled through space combat. Though ground warfare is necessary to achieve ultimate victory, landing armies is safer once the fleet has eliminated the threat of enemy vessels intercepting and destroying vulnerable troop transports. Winning battles across the stars is about adapting to the enemy's loadout and using effective counters. Each offensive or defensive component has a counter-measure to it, meaning that component choices are likely to evolve and change as empires encounter new enemies and try to build ships that counter those of the opponent.

## Combat

Combat in Stellaris takes place in real-time, out of the player's control save for the emergency FTL order. Though the player can direct a fleet toward or away from enemies, there is no control over individual ships (unless they make up a fleet on their own) or which ships they target.

Each fleet is shown on the screen with a strength number. This number represents the power of this fleet, measured by the combined offensive strength of all of the ships in the fleet. This is a rough guide to a fleet's prowess, but **cannot** be understood as an **absolute determinant** in how combat will play out. A fleet that has a lot of offensive weapons that are unsuited for the enemy it is facing (Alien entities with regenerating hulls or skins, enemies with sophisticated and appropriate countermeasures) may still lose to this enemy even though its strength number is considerably higher.

When a fleet engages an enemy ship, enemy station or alien creature in combat, the player gets an alert and the fleet listing in the Outliner has a red battle icon beside it. Select this fleet and you will see a real-time report of the ongoing combat.

At the top of the results sub-screen is a bar measuring the approximate strength of the opposing sides in combat. This bar changes as combat progresses and the odds shift in favor of one or the other side. As the battle progresses, the report sub-screen shows breakdowns of the effectiveness of the weapons systems in use and how much damage the shields, armor and hulls have taken. Analyzing this data helps determine whether current ship builds are effective against this opponent and may indicate ways to improve.

When in combat, every military ship will advance to within a certain range of its intended target and fire its weapons; combat computers determine what range the ship will engage its target from when in combat. Ships that have similar combat computers tend to cluster together, stay in formation with each other and attack in groups.

### Damage

Damage by space combat is distributed onto three layers of protection: Hull Points, Armor, and Shields. Different **weapons** do different amounts of damage to each.

- Hull Points represent the ship's "health" and is the final layer of protection. When Hull Points reach 0, the ship will be destroyed. Furthermore, ships will have their fire rate decreased by a percentage equal to half of the percentage of Hull Points lost. Hull Points are determined by ship size and tech bonuses; a few specialized components can also increase Hull Points.
- Armor provide a second layer of protection, based on the types of Armor components added and tech bonuses.
- Shields provide the first layer of protection, based on the types of Shield components added and tech bonuses. Shields require energy from the ship's reactor, but always regenerate, unlike Hull Points and Armor.

When being attacked, Shields will absorb damage first. After Shields are depleted, Armor will be damaged. After Armor is depleted, Hull Points will be damaged. Some weapons are better or worse than others at depleting Shields and/or Armor; in general, kinetic weapons are strong against shields and weak against armor while energy weapons are strong against armor and weak against shields. Energy weapons also do a bit more damage to Hull Points. Missiles and torpedoes bypass shields to directly damage armor or hull. A few weapons, notably Disruptors, damage Hull Points directly, bypassing all shields and armor, albeit at the cost of dealing much less damage overall and possessing extremely high damage variance. Some components or other sources, like leader traits, can offer armor or shield "hardening", which directly counteracts shield or armor penetration.

When a ship's Hull and/or Armor are damaged, the fastest way to repair them is by docking the fleet with an upgraded Starbase. It is possible to repair ships other than by docking, such as a ship having a self-repair component (like regenerative hull tissue) or a fleet's commander having traits that grant self-repair capability (like Engineer). However, self-repairing is slower than dock-repairing (2% per day or 60% per month). Defense Platforms have a base self-repair rate of 2% per day. It takes 30 days before a Starbase starts to repair itself after combat and there not being any hostile warships in the system. Disabled Starbases reactivate after 6 ticks of repair (36 days).

Some edicts, civics, leader traits and repeatable technologies grant bonuses to shield, armor or hull point capacity:

| Source | Hull bonus |
|---|---|
| Unyielding commander trait | +20% |
| Devouring Swarm civic | +25% |

| Source | Armor bonus |
|---|---|
| Volatile Reactive Armor edict | +25% |
| Matter Compression repeatable technology | +5% |

| Source | Shield bonus |
|---|---|
| Exotic Gases for Shield Boost edict | +25% |
| Shield Harmonics repeatable technology | +5% |

### Accuracy, Tracking, Evasion

Three parameters determine the chance of a weapon to hit its target: the accuracy and tracking of the attacker, and the evasion of the defender.

- **Accuracy** comes primarily from the weapon stats. Accuracy is the percentage chance to hit a target with no evasion. Weapons with high accuracy tend to have comparatively low damage or other weaknesses. Accuracy is capped at 100.
- Tracking **Tracking** comes primarily from the weapon stats as well. Tracking will cancel out some or all of the defender's evasion, and the actual chance to hit is the attacker's accuracy minus the defender's remaining evasion, if any. Smaller weapon sizes usually have significantly higher tracking, with some exceptions.
- **Evasion** is primarily based on hull type and is a defining feature of the Corvette, Destroyer, Transport and similar small ships. It can be increased by thrusters, by the combat computer for some hull sizes, and by Auxiliary modules like the Enigmatic Encoder and by having surplus power in the ship design. Evasion is capped at 90 but higher values will still counter enemy tracking.

The formula to calculate the chance of a specific attack to hit the target is (remember that evasion is capped at 90 and accuracy plus chance to hit is capped at 100):

actual chance to hit = min(100%,accuracy + chance to hit bonus) - max(0, evasion - tracking)

Battleships, stingers, titans, juggernauts and ion cannons will avoid attacking ships with more than 70 evasion unless there are no enemies with less evasion.

Generally, the goal is to pick a weapon that has just enough tracking to maintain the weapon's baseline accuracy, i.e. tracking equal to the enemy's evasion. Thrusters and Sensors mostly cancel each other out when on the same level, so without a serious tech disadvantage, the hull size and weapon sizes matter the most. Large weapons sport much higher damage than smaller weapons, allowing them to destroy their intended targets in just a few shots. However, since said large weapons also tend to have low tracking, ships with high evasion may become nigh-invulnerable to them as they can simply dodge the shots. Weapons with higher tracking, such as small weapons or missiles, are needed when engaging ships with high evasion, such as Corvettes. Conversely, small weapons have high tracking, ensuring that they are able to hit their target without missing much at all. However, they also have low damage and therefore struggle to deal with larger ships such like Cruisers and Battleships due to them having very high shield/armor/hull values, allowing them to absorb shots from small weapons without much difficulty. Large weapons with high damage are needed for dealing with ships that have such high durability.

### Ship military power

Military power of a ship or a fleet is an estimate of its combined offensive and defensive capabilities. Armor and shields are weighted equally, while ship hull points get a 0.5 multiplier. Ship evasion also increases the effective health. Weapon damage per day and other properties of weapons, such as shield and armor penetration, are factored in too. Ship Speed is not part of this equation.

military powerthicksim (effective health * damage per day)^(0.65)

### Force Disparity

Force Disparity is a combat bonus applied when a smaller force is engaged with a larger one (based on total combined fleet size) in battle and gives a bonus to the Fire Rate of all ships belonging to the smaller force. Force Disparity scales linearly with the fleet size difference (however an extra 20? Fleet Size is added to each side) so, for example, a ship force that is engaging a hostile ship force 50% larger will have up to +50% fire rate, representing how the smaller force has an easier time maneuvering and targeting the larger enemy force. It caps at 100%, when fighting a fleet twice larger.

Force Disparity alone will not enable a much smaller force to win unless it has a significant technological advantage. It will, however, ensure that all but the most overwhelming forces will take casualties and bear a cost for their victory.

## Ship disengagement

Once a ship loses 50% of its Hull Points, it will attempt to disengage. A ship that disengages will instantly leave the battle and rejoin the fleet at the end, until then appearing in the combat interface with a white flag icon indicating that it has disengaged. If a fleet contains only disengaged ships, it will make an emergency retreat.

Ships will never disengage if the owner uses the No Retreat War Doctrine policy.

The chance for a ship to disengage is the following: chance = damage / hull * 1.5 * ship multiplier * 1.25 text if within friendly borders

Damage: Amount of damage the hit inflicted Hull: The ship's maximum hull points Ship multiplier: Ship type multiplier

| Ship multiplier | Ship type |
|---|---|
| 2 | Science Ship |
| 1.5 | Destroyer, Cruiser, Transport Ship |
| 1.25 | Battleship, Titan |
| 1 | Corvette, Frigate, Construction Ship |
| 0.5 | Colony Ship |
| 0.2 | Meteor Colony Ship |

The chance for ships to disengage can also be affected by the following modifiers:

| Combat disengagement chance (empire) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| The Key triumph effect (3 months) | +75% |
| Hit and Run War Doctrine policy | +33% |

| Energy major deficit | −25% |
| Energy severe deficit | −50% |
| Energy catastrophic deficit | −75% |
| No Retreat War Doctrine policy | −100% |

| Combat disengagement chance (system) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Black Hole system | −50% |
| Communications Jammer starbase aura | −20% |
| Subspace Snare titan aura | −20% |

| Combat disengagement chance (assigned leader) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Evasiveness III scientist trait | +100% |
| Evasiveness II scientist trait | +50% |
| Trickster II commander trait | +40% |
| Chosen of the Instrument commander trait | +35% |
| Evasiveness I scientist trait | +25% |
| Trickster I commander trait | +20% |

| Unyielding I commander trait | −33% |
| Hell's Heart paragon trait | −33% |
| Reckless I commander trait | −20% |
| Reckless II commander trait | −60% |

If a ship fails every disengagement attempt, it must remain until the end of combat or its destruction. Ships have no disengagement opportunities by default. Disengagement opportunities are gained for each of the following:

| Source | Disengagement Opportunities |
|---|---|
| Commander level 5-9 | +1 |
| Commander level 10 | +2 |
| Guerilla Tactician commander trait | +1 |
| Hit and Run War Doctrine policy | +1 |
| Enigmatic Encoder ship component | +1 |
| Hyperdrives except Subspace Drive and Psi Jump Drive | +1 |
| Psi Jump Drive ship component | +2 |

## Emergency retreat

All ships of a fleet in combat have the opportunity to trigger an emergency retreat in the middle of a battle. This is a sudden escape using each individual ship's equipped FTL engine, whether it is a Hyperdrive or Jump Drive, that allows the fleet to escape destruction. The order is given by pressing the **Retreat** button in the combat sub-screen and the retreat can be triggered even from deep within the system. While in Evasive stance, a fleet will automatically retreat once the option is available. AI fleets in neutral or hostile territory will always retreat if half of the fleet is destroyed.

There are some tradeoffs, however:

1. The fleet will go "missing in action" upon retreat for a number of months depending on how far the ship was from its home starbase. While MIA, it can be neither controlled nor attacked while moving back to its home starbase. Its leader, if any, can also not be reassigned.
2. Ships require 14 days after entering combat before they can retreat. Smaller, weaker fleets (like newly built ships attempting to reinforce a larger fleet) are therefore especially vulnerable to being annihilated.
3. The hastily calculated nature of the FTL jump leads to each ship having a 25% chance to take up to 75% hull damage. There is also a 5% chance for each ship to be destroyed outright.

The chances to take damage can be reduced by Emergency FTL Damage Risk modifiers:

| Source | Modifier |
|---|---|
| Hit and Run War Doctrine policy | −25% |
| Trickster admiral trait | −15% |
| Enclave Trader, Caravan Counter admiral trait | −10% |

The 14-day charge time can be increased by Emergency FTL Jump Cooldown modifiers:

| Source | Modifier |
|---|---|
| FTL Inhibitor starbase aura | +100% |
| Subspace Snare titan aura | +100% |
| Black hole | +50% |
| No Retreat War Doctrine policy | +50% |

## AI of fleets in space combat

### Positioning

In combat, each ship of a fleet will function independently. Ships have two modes of operation during combat: an attack-move-pattern and a passive-move-pattern , and they can switch between them due to conditions during the battle. For example, a ship with a Swarm combat computer installed would

– pick a target

– turn on the passive-move-pattern and charge at the target until the distance to target is 10 (the so-called formation distance )

– then, as formation distance is reached, the attack-move-pattern will turn on and the ship will start to orbit the target and attack it. This orbit radius is defined by the preferred attack range , and in this case it will be the minimal range or the smallest range among all weapons equipped.

In general, the preferred attack range depends on the ship's installed combat computer and on the ranges of its weapons. The wording "medium range" for the Picket and Line combat computers should be interpreted as the mathematical median of all the weapons' ranges the ship has. As an example: if a ship has 5 weapons with max ranges 30, 30, 30, 100, 150, then the the ship's "medium range" would be 30. However, if the ship has even number of weapons, the "medium range" will fall on the one with longer range among the two weapons in the middle instead of their average. For example: if a ship has 4 weapons with max ranges 30, 30, 120, 150, the "medium range" of the ship would be 120.

It is noticeable that when calculating the minimal/maximal/median range of a ship, strike craft are often excluded, meaning that installing strike craft on a battleship with an Artillery combat computer will **not** have any effect on its preferred attack range. The only exception in the game for now is the Carrier combat computer, which counts **only** the ranges of its strike craft and ignores other weapons if there are strike craft installed. If there aren't any strike craft on the ship, then a Carrier combat computer will behave like an Artillery combat computer, calculating the distances using other weapons' ranges.

The condition for a ship to switch back from the attack-move-pattern to the passive-move-pattern is the following: a set return to formation distance is smaller than the distance from the ship to a chosen position in space, corresponding to the preferred attack range for target. In other words – the target is too far away.

This table gives a overview of all move patterns and distance rules used by each combat computer:

| Combat computer program | Preferred attack range | attack-move-pattern | Formation distance | passive-move-pattern | Return to formation distance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Swarm | minimal range | Orbit | 10 | Charge | 60 |
| Picket | medium range | Stay at range | medium range | Orbit | maximal range |
| Line | medium range | Stay at range | medium range | Charge | maximal range |
| Artillery | medium range | Maintain distance | medium range | Stay at range | medium range |
| Carrier | maximal range | Maintain distance | maximal range | Stay at range | maximal range |
| Torpedo | 10 | Charge | 10 | Charge | maximal range |
| Platform | maximal range | Stationary | 40 | none | 20 |

The behaviors seem self-explanatory, but many of them don't contain necessary details about how the ship will move in combat, which will be explained below.

Charge is very simple: the ship charges at max speed, quickly approaching the target.

Orbit is not very clear; it is observed that, when ships orbit , they seems to be drawing arcs and circles around but not centering the target.

Stay at range means that a ship will attempt to keep the target within its range. More specifically, as a passive-move-pattern , it will make the ship head for the target at max speed before it reaches formation distance . After that, as a attack-move-pattern , it makes the ship slow down and push in a slow speed that is not affected by the ship's speed, until it reaches 70% of its formation distance , where it will stay stationary and fire at the target. If the target gets closer to the ship, it will not do anything; if the target gets further, then it will start pushing slowly until it reaches 70% of its formation distance again. It should be noted that, if the ship is using a weapon that has a minimum range like kinetic artillery, and the ship is using stay at range behavior, it will not move even when the target is too close for the weapon to fire!

Maintain distance is similar to stay at range in some ways, though it is only used in game as an attack-move-pattern (as of version v3.14.1592). A ship using this behavior will also push slowly, but instead of 70%, stops at 90% of formation distance . After the target moves closer than 70% of formation distance , the ship will "back off" in order to increase its range to the target. In other words, the ship will attempt to keep the enemy in the range of 70% to 90% of its formation distance . Note that since ships need time to turn back and accelerate, using this behavior will not keep the distance between the ship and the target larger than 70% formation distance .

### Targeting

Ship targeting is done in an automatic fashion using a system of weights and conditions during space combat. It is hidden from the player and can't be manipulated by the player, but it might still be helpful to know some of the mechanics used in the process. The exact mechanics are not fully known. However, a number of values can be extracted from the Stellaris/common/defines/00_defines.txt file.

- There is a mechanic to target smaller or more fragile ships. The weight is small, and because of the influence of other variables like evasion, in real combat scenarios it turns out that ships with bigger sizes are usually targeted first, as bigger ships usually have lower evasion and ships prefer targeting enemies with lower evasion. However, it seems that there is a size cap for this mechanism, which is 10, so when titans and battleships are fighting together and assuming that they have same evasion, titans might be a little less likely to be the target.
- There is a mechanic for high-tracking ships to specifically target high-evasion ships.
- There is a mechanic for low-health ships (50% health threshold) to be priority targeted.
- There is a mechanic for closer ships to be targeted first.
- There is a mechanic to ignore and not target civilian and unarmed ships during space combat.
- There is a mechanic for ships to be a bit less likely to target Starbases over military ships and defense platforms.
- There is a mechanic for ships which have a size larger than or equal to 8, like battleships and titans, to avoid firing on highly evasive targets (70% evasion threshold).
- There is a mechanic for missiles to re-target should they lose their initial target. The first re-target success chance is 100%, second re-target attempt is 65%, third 30%, fourth 0%.
