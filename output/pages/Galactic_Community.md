# Galactic Community

The **Galactic Community** is a governing body where each member empire can vote on laws that affect all other member empires. Any empire that established communications with a Galactic Community member is able to join or leave. Leaving the Galactic Community costs between 100 and 500 influence, depending on Empire Size. If an empire leaves, it will be unable to rejoin for 20 years and suffer a permanent −30 opinion penalty with the current Galactic Community members until it rejoins. Members of the Galactic Community are automatically given communications if they haven't encountered each other yet. Genocidal empires cannot join the Galactic Community.

## Formation

Once an empire that is not Gestalt Consciousness or Fanatic Purifiers has established communications with at least 70% of the other empires in the galaxy (at least 3 non-Genocidal empires must exist), all non-Genocidal empires will be invited to form the Galactic Community. If at least 3 empires agree, the Galactic Community will be created, and all empires that voted to form will be members. When the option to form or join the Galactic Community is offered, AI empires will vote with the following weights:

| Yes Yes | No No |
|---|---|
| - **15**<br>- +3 if Xenophile<br>- +10 if Fanatic Xenophile<br>- +10 if either of:<br>  - Diplomatic Corps<br>  - Public Relations Specialists<br>  - Empath<br>  - Rogue Servitor | - **5**<br>- +3 if Xenophobe<br>- +10 if Fanatic Xenophobe |

Joining the Galactic Community after it has formed costs 100 influence.

## Senate

The Galactic Senate is where resolutions are proposed and voted. It goes through two recurring phases.

When the Senate is in **Recess** , no resolution is voted on. When the recess ends, the proposed resolution with the highest diplomatic support will be put in Session. An empire that’s part of the Galactic Council can declare a resolution an emergency measure every 20 years, instantly ending the recess. A recess lasts 720 days.

When the Senate is in **Session** , all empires vote on the debated resolution. Supporting or opposing a resolution will add an empire’s diplomatic weight to either side while abstaining will not add diplomatic weight to either side. All empires can change their vote every 4 months. When the session ends, the resolution is passed if the total Diplomatic weight of empires that supported it exceeds the total Diplomatic weight of empires that opposed it. A Session lasts 1440 days. An empire that’s the Custodian can end a session after half its time has passed.

### Diplomatic weight

Diplomatic weight is a measure of how influential an empire is within the senate and determines its power when supporting or opposing resolutions that are proposed or voted on. Diplomatic weight is gained from fleet power, economy, technology and pops. Assigning an Official to the galactic community increases diplomatic weight by +10% per leader level.

- **Economic weight** is 15% of the empire’s economic power
- **Fleet power weight** is 2.5% of fleet power
- **Technology weight** is 40% of technology level
- **Pops weight** is the sum of each pop’s contribution which is described by: Pop's weight = 2 * Pop's happiness + 1 . The political power of the pop is not considered. All pops that are not affected by happiness contribute 1 to diplomatic weight from pops. Pops that have subversive jobs do not contribute.

### Voting

When a resolution comes to the Senate floor, all member empires can support, oppose, or abstain. The total diplomatic weight of empires supporting and opposing the resolution is compared and the side with the higher total prevails. By spending 10 Influence per favor, any member can use up to 10 favors from each member voting opposite to themselves to add 10% of that member's diplomatic weight to their side of the vote; this does not reduce that member's diplomatic weight. Only 100 favors total may be used per resolution.

### Resolutions

Resolutions are laws passed by the Galactic Senate and affect every member of the Galactic Community. Any member can propose a resolution at any time, which is then added to the proposal list. Each member can only propose one resolution in the list. After a resolution is added to the list, all member empires can support it, oppose it or abstain, which determines its Diplomatic Support. The total Diplomatic Support or a resolution also determines its place in the list.

There are 5 resolution trees, each one containing at least two resolution lists. Most resolution lists contain 5 resolutions each, which must be passed in order, in addition to the option to vote to repeal the current highest level resolution in a list. Sanction resolution lists contain 3 resolutions each. Once a resolution passes, another resolution from the same list, including the option to repel the new resolution, cannot be proposed until a resolution from another list is voted on.

The resolutions, depending on their tier, require 100, 150, 200, 250 or 300 Influence to propose. An empire can withdraw its own proposed resolution to propose another one but the cost is not refunded. Proposing to repeal a resolution costs as much as it took to initially propose it.

When a resolution that bans a policy is passed, all members of the Galactic Community that use it are given the option to change the policy every 10 years as long as their ethics allow.

An empire that has proposed a resolution will gain for 6 years +5% Diplomatic weight if the resolution passes and −5% diplomatic weight if it fails.

AI empires will never vote for resolutions that would cause them to be in breach of Galactic Law and will always vote for repealing them. If the AI is neutral on an issue, it will vote solely based on its Opinion of the empire that proposed the resolution and will not use Favors to influence voting.

Gestalt Consciousness empires are not affected by modifiers that have no effect on their pops or planets, making certain resolutions have fewer drawbacks or benefits than they would for other empires.

#### Sanctions

Sanctions are resolutions that apply negative modifiers to empires that are in breach of Galactic Law or have been denounced and can only be proposed after such a thing is possible. The last two levels for each Sanction can only be proposed by members of the Galactic Council. All Sanctions require 25 Influence to propose.

AI empires are 25% more likely to vote for a Sanction resolution if a Rival is denounced or in breach of the Galactic Law but 50% less likely if a member of the same Federation is denounced or in breach of Galactic Law. They will always oppose resolutions if they themselves are in breach of Galactic Law. AI empires will never join the Galactic Community and will always leave it if they are in breach of 3 or more resolutions and can afford it.

| Sanction type | Effects | Minor | Moderate | Major | AI voting weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Economic | Market Fee Diplomatic weight from economy | +10% −20% | +20% −40% | +30% −60% | ×1.25 if Corporate |
| Administrative | Monthly Unity Diplomatic Influence Cost | −10% +25% | −20% +50% | −30% +75% | - ×1.25 if Xenophile<br>- ×1.25 if (either) |
| Research | Research Speed Diplomatic weight from technology | −5% −20% | −10% −40% | −15% −60% | ×1.25 if Materialist |
| Military | Naval Capacity Diplomatic weight from fleet power | −10% −20% | −20% −40% | −30% −60% | - ×1.25 if Militarist<br>- ×1.25 if Pacifist |

#### Space Fauna

The Space Fauna resolutions determine the status of various space fauna. They are only available if the matching space fauna has not been exterminated and cost 25 Influence to propose. Space Amoeba Protection Act can only be proposed by empires that pacified Space Amoeba.

| Resolution | Effects | AI voting weight |
|---|---|---|
| Resolution tiyanki **Tiyanki Conservation Act** The Tiyanki are a unique form of spacefaring life, and they must be protected from those who would do them harm. | - Killing Tiyanki or the Tiyanki Matriarch Guardian breaches Galactic Law for 10 years<br>- Killing Tiyanki grants no rewards and causes a −1000 Energy fine<br>- Killing the Tiyanki Matriarch guardian causes a −5000 Energy fine | - ×2 if Fruitful Partnership<br>- ×2 if Xenophile<br>- ×1.5 if Pacifist<br>- ×1.5 if Environmentalist<br>- ×1.5 if Empath<br>- ×0.75 if Militarist<br>- ×0 if Xenophobe<br>- ×0 if Cordyceptic Drones |
| Resolution tiyanki **Space Amoeba Protection Act** Despite their unseeming looks, the Space Amoebas have as much right to roam the galaxy as any species. They must be treated as a form of life worth cherishing, not as vermin to be hunted down. | - All members are offered the Amoeboid Pacification empire modifier<br>- Refusing puts the empire in breach of Galactic Law | |
| Resolution tiyanki hunt **Tiyanki Pest Control** The roving Tiyanki are not only a nuisance, but also a navigational hazard.

| Resolution voidworm eradication **Voidworm Eradication** The parasitic Voidworms are a blight on the galaxy and a threat to populated worlds. Their natural lifecycle offsets the balance of the galactic ecosystem and all should be eliminated. | Bans having wild Voidworms within empire borders | |

#### Denouncement

Denouncements are a unique type of resolution that targets a certain member empire. If the denouncement resolution passes, the denounced empire will get a −25% diplomatic weight modifier for 10 years. If the empire is a member of the Galactic Community, it will be affected by Sanction resolutions even if it didn't breach Galactic Law. A denouncement resolution can only be proposed against empires with rivalry or negative Relations. There are two types of denouncements:

- Castigation denouncements cost 25 influence and can be proposed by any empire if the 4th Mutual Defense resolution is passed against an empire that is either in breach of the Galactic Law or is not a member of the Galactic Community
- Council denouncements cost 100 influence can be proposed by members of the Galactic Council against any member of the Galactic Community

#### Politics Traditions

The Politics Traditions resolutions can only be proposed by empires that finished the Politics tradition tree and cost 250 Influence to propose.

#### Galactic Market

The Galactic Market resolutions determine what pops can be sold on the slave market and cost 25 Influence to propose. If "Ban Sentient Slave Trade" resolution has been passed, it can't be repealed.

| Resolution | Organic pops | Mechanical pops | AI voting weight | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Allow Organic Slave Trade (starting) | Yes | Yes | - ×2 Barbaric Despoilers<br>- ×2 Nihilistic Acquisition<br>- ×1.5 if Authoritarian<br>- ×1.5 if Xenophobe<br>- ×0.5 if Egalitarian<br>- ×0.5 if Xenophile | Economic indicators prove that our earlier restrictions on the organic slave trade were clearly in error. We should repeal the ban and let the free market do its magic. |
| Ban Organic Slave Trade | No | Yes | - ×1.5 if Egalitarian<br>- ×1.5 if Xenophile<br>- ×0.5 if Authoritarian<br>- ×0.5 if Xenophobe<br>- ×0 Barbaric Despoilers<br>- ×0 Nihilistic Acquisition | The use of the Galactic Market to trade in sentient organics is abominable.

We should rectify this mistake and ban the trade of all sentients on the Galactic Market. |

#### Pre-FTL Stance

The Pre-FTL Stance resolutions determine in what ways members of the Galactic Community are allowed to interact with pre-FTL civilizations . Only one Pre-FTL Stance resolution can be active and it must be repealed before another one can be proposed. All resolutions cost 100 Influence.

| Resolution | Effects | Bans | AI voting weight |

### Galactic Focus

The Galactic Focus is the current objective of the Galactic Community and when accomplished will grant every member of the Galactic Community 100 Influence. Galactic Focus options only appear when certain conditions are met. The Galactic Focus can be changed by proposing a Galactic Priority resolution. If an empire is Custodian, it can change the Galactic Focus without requiring a resolution. Both options cost 100 Influence.

### Galactic Council

The Galactic Council can be created by passing the Form Galactic Council resolution, which requires the Galactic Community to be at least 20 years old. Members are chosen from the member empires with the highest diplomatic weight every 20 years and have their diplomatic weight increased by +20% , can propose Council denouncement resolutions and can declare a proposed resolution an emergency measure and put it into session immediately once every 20 years. After the Galactic Council is created, the Galactic Reforms resolution list will be added.

The Nominate Custodian resolution cannot target empires that are subjects or have a crisis ascension perk. If the the resolution is either in the queue or being debated when the targeted empire becomes invalid for it, it is withdrawn.

If the Growth Shattered Fragment fallen empire awakens it will unlock these resolutions even if the required DLC is not owned.

#### Crisis declaration

If there is a Custodian, that empire or members of the Galactic Council can propose crisis declaration Resolutions. Crisis declaration Resolutions cost 300 to propose or repeal. They will start a Total War between the Galactic Community or Galactic Imperium and the target using the Crisis War wargoal and the targeted empire cannot rejoin the Galactic Community or Galactic Imperium. During the war, member empires gain +20% ship build speed and −10% ship upkeep. The war will end prematurely if the resolution is repealed and an empire leaving the Galactic Community will also leave the war.

#### Galactic Custodian

A Custodian can be chosen from the members of the Galactic Council by passing the Nominate Custodian resolution. Empires that picked any player crisis ascension perk, or has the Pompous Purists civic cannot propose the nomination resolution or be nominated. Empires are more likely to approve of a Custodian being nominated if there is a crisis or an Awakened Empire currently active in the galaxy. The Custodian enjoys the following benefits:

- +5 Monthly influence
- +30% Diplomatic weight (replaces the Council bonus)
- −50% Emergency measure cooldown
- −50% Veto cost and cooldown
- Open borders from every member of the Galactic Community
- Can end any session after half its time has passed at the cost of 200 influence
- Can change the Galactic Focus without requiring a resolution at the cost of 100 influence
- Can freeze any resolution, preventing it from being voted on (the empire with the frozen resolution can still withdraw it to propose another one)
- Cannot be targeted by subjugation casus belli

Initially, an empire stays Custodian for 30 years and afterwards returns to the Galactic Council. Any active resolutions passed during Custodianship will remain in effect. These resolutions can be repealed, but additional Custodian resolutions cannot be proposed. Custodians can propose the following unique resolutions for 200 influence:

| Group | Resolution | Effects | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| Term Limits | Extend Custodianship | Time +30 Years Custodian term | - No Remove Custodianship Term Limit<br>- Can only be used once |
| Remove Custodianship Term Limit | Time No Custodian term limit | | |

Galactic Defense Force (GDF for short) is a fleet that can be constructed by the Custodian if they pass the resolution with the same name. GDF fleets do not have any upkeep but are limited to a total Naval Capacity of 400, which may be expanded by resolutions.

The Custodian designs the GDF ships via a special ship designer available in the Galactic Community menu and may use any technology available to any member empire. Regular ship designs cannot be used to build GDF ships. The Custodian is responsible for commanding the GDF fleets. Any AI Galactic Community member's research of a component-unlocking technology will auto-update the default GDF designs, but not any player-created ones, adding theirs to the list instead.

If the Custodian's term ends while the Galactic Defense Force exists, it will become a neutral fleet that patrols Galactic Community space. If the Galactic Community becomes the Galactic Imperium the Galactic Defense Force will become the Imperial Armada and its ship appearance will switch to the Imperial set.

The Galactic Defense Force has its own Titan limit, which does not affect the number of Titans Galactic Community members can construct individually.

If any Galactic Community member has the Artificial Breeding technology, space fauna can also be designed for the GDF.

## Galactic Imperium

Note: Even without the Nemesis DLC, the Galactic Imperium Resolution can still occur if it's proposed by an Awakened Empire.

If the Proclaim the Galactic Imperium Resolution is passed, the Galactic Community will be reformed into the Galactic Imperium. All Galactic Imperium members will leave any federation they're part of and cannot form or join new ones. The Custodian will become the Galactic Emperor, with a new name depending on previous authority, shift ethics towards Fanatic Authoritarian, shift government to Imperial, gain the Galactic Sovereign civic and gain the ability to upgrade the planetary capital of the empire capital into the Imperial Palace. If the Galactic Emperor previously had Corporate authority, it will shift government as well but become able to use both regular and corporate civics. All Custodian perks will remain and in addition.

The Galactic Emperor cannot be attacked by Galactic Imperium members and empires cannot leave the Galactic Imperium. If a member of the Galactic Imperium is attacked by an empire who is not part of the Galactic Imperium, the Galactic Emperor will have the option to join the war. Joining the war increases Imperial Authority by +20 and opinion with the defender by +250 while refusing decreases Imperial Authority by −20 and opinion with the defender by −250 .

When the Galactic Imperium is formed, the Galactic Council will be reformed into the Imperial Council. Galactic Reform Resolutions will be replaced by Imperial Council ones, which can only be proposed by the Galactic Emperor. In addition, the Galactic Trade Organization Resolution will be moved to the Imperial Institutions group and A United Front to Foreign Relations.

If the empire leading the Galactic Imperium is conquered or destroyed, the Galactic Imperium will revert to being the Galactic Community. Resolutions specific to the Galactic Imperium will be repealed but other existing resolutions will remain active.

The Galactic Emperor will be able to propose the following Resolutions:

| Group | Resolution | Cost | Effects | Requirements |

### Undermining the Imperial Authority

The Galactic Imperium measures its strength via Imperial Authority. Officials can be assigned to the Galactic Imperium to raise or lower Imperial Authority by 0.1 per month each. This is done via the Galactic Imperium screen as shown in the image. They can be assigned (by clicking either icon) to support or undermine the Imperium. In addition to this, an Espionage Operation exists to Weaken Imperial Authority .

If the Imperial Authority is at least 100, all members of the Galactic Imperium will join the Galactic Emperor in defensive wars. If it falls below 50, members can use the Spark Rebellion espionage operation to attempt to bring down the Emperor. This operation requires a very high Infiltration Level, so it may be required to acquire additional assets first. In addition to the high starting requirements, events may happen that demand to sacrifice the assigned asset and thus lowering the maximum infiltration level. The Contact Lost event requires 10 more infiltration level than the starting requirement of the operation was originally.

Subject empires can only influence Imperial Authority if their terms of agreement include Independent Diplomacy.

AI empires will undermine Imperial Authority if they are not a subject of the galactic emperor and their Opinion of the galactic emperor is −300 or less or if they are a subject of the galactic emperor their Loyalty is −1 or less. They will support Imperial Authority if they are not a subject of the galactic emperor and their Opinion of the galactic emperor is 750 or more or if they are a subject of the galactic emperor their Loyalty is 0 or more.

## Galactic Law

The Galactic Law represents actions that are forbidden within the Galactic Community. When the Galactic Community is formed nothing is forbidden, but passed resolutions can ban certain policies and actions. If a member of the Galactic Community breaches the Galactic Law all other members will lose 100 opinion with the breaching empire. In addition, as long as an empire is in breach of Galactic Law it will be affected by passed Sanction resolutions. Sanction resolutions themselves can only be proposed after at least one thing is banned by Galactic Law. AI empires that are in breach of at least 3 resolutions will leave the Galactic Community.
