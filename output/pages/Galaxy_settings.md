# Galaxy settings

**Galaxy Settings** are the various changes that the player can make before starting a single player or multiplayer game. These settings can be used to make game sessions shorter or longer, simpler or more complex, as well as to increase the difficulty if desired.

## General settings

### Gameplay

Gameplay settings affect how difficult the game will be for human players.

#### Difficulty

The difficulty setting gives the AI bonuses at higher settings and gives human players bonuses at lower settings. Higher difficulty also increases the strength of the endgame crisis. AI vassals of human players receive bonuses as though difficulty were one level lower.

Ironman is an optional game mode that restricts the player’s control over their save file, effectively removing the ability to correct mistakes and change decisions made during the course of play.

Console commands and even option to open the console are also disabled.
