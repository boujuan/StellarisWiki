# Astral rift

**Astral rifts** are tears in time and space that lead to other universes. With Astral Planes enabled, the galaxy will generate a new kind of celestial object called an "Astral Scar", which can potentially open up into an Astral Rift. The first time an astral rift is encountered, it starts the A Rift in Space situation . Each astral rift provides a deposit of 2 astral threads which may be exploited by constructing a research station above the astral rift. Completing any chapter usually grants a reward of astral threads as well. The name of an astral rift only becomes visible after its first chapter has been completed.

Completed astral rifts, if the Blorgs don't exist in the galaxy and the player isn't using their species portrait , have a 2% chance to spawn the renowned paragon Mercedes Romero .

## Exploration mechanics

Exploring an astral rift requires the rift to be within the empire's borders, the **Rift Sphere** technology, and a scientist and science ship assigned to it. The scientist remains within the rift and uncovers its secrets over the course of multiple chapters , with each chapter providing a part of the rift's story.

| Result total | Outcome | Exp |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 14 | Completes the current chapter | 75 |
| 10 - 13 | Adds 2 clues for the next phase | 40 |
| 5 - 9 | Adds 1 clue for the next phase | 25 |
| 4 ≤ | May trigger failure, or no effect | 10 |

Exploration proceeds in phases of 90 days; this time can be modified by leader traits and other modifiers. At the end of each phase, a die is rolled, with a random result from 1 to 10; adding the current number of clues and the scientist's Astral Rift Skill and subtracting the chapter's difficulty gives the total result, as in the following formula:

: Result = Dice Roll + Scientist Skill + Bonus + Clues - Difficulty .

The scientist's skill is equal to the scientist's level, plus any modifiers from leader traits, including councilors .

A result of 14 or greater completes the current chapter; a result of 10-13 adds two clues for the next phase, a result of 5-9 adds one clue, a result of 4 or less adds no clues. Completing the chapter gives the scientist 75 experience; finding two clues gives them 40 experience, one clue 25 experience. Even when finding no clues still gives the scientist 10 experience. Clues gained from events, however, do not automatically give experience.

Finding no clues has a 1.5% (0.75% for empires with the Riftworld origin) chance of failing the chapter. Only some certain chapters can be failed as most don't have a failure effect.

Exploration of astral rifts cannot be done by councilors and cannot be stopped once started.

## Progressive spawn

After the mid-game year is reached, every Empire with eligible systems will have a yearly chance to split an existing astral scar into an astral rift, or - only if no astral scars remain - to generate a new astral scar.

This chance (out of 100) is the following:

2*years since last spawn*additional weight + eligible systems / 3

Where:

- Years since last spawn only increases on a roll - that is, if there are eligible systems and progressive spawn is not on a 10-year moratorium.
- Additional weight is 1 by default, but multiplied by 2 with the Riftworld origin, by 2 again with the Dimensional Worship civic and by 10 if the Empire has begun the A Rift in Space situation but lost their last Astral Rift
- A system is eligible if it either has an astral scar with no anomalies, or can spawn an astral scar, that is:
 - It is not a starting system, a Fallen Empire system, or another special system (see has_special_star_flag_trigger for a full list)
 - It can already spawn an astral scar/rift and does not neighbour any system with an astral scar/rift

The chance is further lowered by a flat 25 points if the Empire has already completed 5 astral rifts.

After an astral scar is split or a new astral scar is generated, no more can be generated for 10 years.

# Genesis

**Genesis** is a unique Astral rift : it can only spawn once per galaxy. It cannot spawn for empires that do not have at least one colony.

In this rift, unless the player chooses to abort in the first chapter they will build a new species from a pre-sapient life on the other side of the rift. At the end of the rift, one pop of the new species is placed on a random colony within the player's empire.

## Summary of Possible Outcomes

| Chapter | Outcome |
|---|---|
| 1 | - large astral threads reward ( 140 , 150 , or 160 )<br>- 48x alloys output ( 700~30 000 ) |

## The Mirror Empire

Upon establishing contact with the Mirror Empire they are added to the player's contacts menu, where they will be for the rest of the game. There is no way to remove the Mirror Empire.

The Mirror Empire has the same leader species but has opposite ethics. For example, if the player empire has Authoritarian and Fanatic Spiritualist then the Mirror Empire will have Egalitarian and Fanatic Materialist. If the player empire is a Gestalt Consciousness then the Mirror Empire will be also.

Relations with the Mirror Empire are always positive due to a permanent +150 Opinion bonus. The only possible interactions are forming a Commercial Pact, forming a Rivalry (which does not have the usual restrictions), or trading resources. The Mirror Empire has unlimited resources to trade. If the Mirror Empire is any degree of File:Xenophobe ethic gradient.png Xenophobe then it will always refuse trade offers.

# The Microverse

**The Microverse** is a semi-unique Astral rift ; each empire can only encounter it once per game.

For this rift to spawn, all of the following conditions must be met:

- Astral Harvesting must have been researched.
- Rift Sphere must have been researched.
- An astral scar already exists within the empire's borders.

Once these conditions are true, upon surveying a new astral scar there is an 80% chance to issue the Astral Scar Instability special project. If the project is not started within 3 years of issue then it will expire and never be offered again. Once started the project takes 60 days to complete, during which the system will gain −50% Sublight Speed and −100% Trade Value. Finishing the project will give the option to open **The Microverse** astral rift or seal it for a large astral threads reward ( 140 , 150 , or 160 ) and a large amount of Physics Research.

# Crystal Rift

The **Crystal Rift** is a unique astral rift and midgame crisis which can spawn exactly once per game (not per empire). The rift has a unique appearance.

The rift is spawned when an empire completes the Study the Crystal Sphere situation . Once the mid-game year has been reached, the game checks annually for eligible empires to receive the situation. The minimum requirements for an empire to be considered are as follow:

- Must have researched the **Rift Sphere** technology.
- Must have completed 5 or more astral rifts.
- Must have completed the most astral rifts.
 - In the event of a tie, randomness is employed which is weighted to favor player empires and heavily favor Riftworld origin empires.

- Must have a system which is not Sol and does not contain a wormhole or shroud tunnel .

See the situation page for more details.

## The Strange Wormhole

Completing the rift by choosing "We've opened a doorway..." will spawn the Strange Wormhole in the system where the rift occurred. The wormhole leads to the azilash system at the center of the galaxy. An empire does **not** need to have Wormhole Stabilization researched in order to complete the Study the Crystal Sphere situation or the rift and spawn the Strange Wormhole, however Wormhole Stabilization must be researched in order to travel through it. Only the empire which finished the Crystal Rift can ever enter the Strange Wormhole, even if another empire captures the system containing the Strange Wormhole.

The other side of the wormhole initially contains 8 hostile Aberrant fleets of 8 cruisers each (5k power each at civilian difficulty, scaling up). Destroying all fleets starts the The Seal situation which, if completed successfully, can give a legendary paragon and additional bonuses, a Luminarium subject and the Eternal Throne relic, or a war which gives the Eternal Throne relic if won. Because The Seal spawns fleets which are far more powerful than those initially present in azilash, players may wish to postpone traveling through the Strange Wormhole until prepared with fleets powerful enough to complete The Seal .

Aside from delaying receipt of the Eternal Throne relic, there are no negative consequences to postponing initial travel through the Strange Wormhole. The wormhole is permanent and cannot be entered by other empires, whether explored or not.

### azilash system

The azilash system appears at the center of the galaxy after an empire has completed the Crystal Rift. With broad enough sensor range, ships will be able to detect the existence of the system without travelling there. The system always contains deposits totaling 1 astral threads, 10 rare crystals, and 10 physics research.

There are exactly two ways to access the system:

- Travel through the Strange Wormhole which is created as a result of the Crystal Rift, only available to the empire who finished it.
- With the Overlord DLC, a Quantum Catapult can be used to deposit fleets in the system which will start the The Seal situation as if they had entered via the wormhole. This is the only method available for empires who did not get the Crystal Rift.

The system initially contains a starbase belonging to a neutral race called the Formless, and 8 hostile Aberrant fleets of 8 cruisers each (5k power each at civilian difficulty, scaling up). Destroying all fleets starts the The Seal situation . Because The Seal spawns fleets which are far more powerful than those initially present in azilash, players may wish to postpone traveling to azilash until prepared with fleets powerful enough to complete The Seal .

If the situation is completed successfully then the system gains a size 40 Gaia World named zeya with the Terraforming Candidate, Formless Haven modifier. Subjugating the Formless causes them to become a Luminarium which cannot be integrated.

While the Crystal Rift does not affect any empire but the one who triggered the situation, the game does consider it to be a crisis. While The Seal is ongoing, empires will gain bonuses related to crisis events, such as increased bonuses for diplomacy actions such as joining federations , and if the situation is triggered around the end-game year, certain Fallen Empires may even awaken as Guardians of the Galaxy, despite their inability to interact with the event.

Should the Aberrant succeed in destroying the Formless, the entire system is destroyed, with the Astral Star going nova and destroying every ship present. The system then becomes inaccessible.

## Summary of Possible Outcomes

These are all of the possible end results for terminating the rift. This table does not include rewards given for intervening chapters.

| Chapter | Outcome |
|---|---|
| 3-A | - large astral threads reward ( 140 , 150 , or 160 )<br>- 96x unity output ( 2000~2 000 000 ) |
| 5 | - Spawns the Strange Wormhole giving access to the azilash system and the The Seal situation, successful completion of which could result in a paragon, a Luminarium subject, or the Eternal Throne relic. See the situation page for more details. |
| 6 | This outcome is only possible if the<br>Wormhole Stabilization technology has already been researched:<br>- The rift gains a deposit of +10 unity and +10 physics research. |

# Desert Ruins

**Desert Ruins** is a non-unique Astral rift ; therefore this storyline can be encountered multiple times within a single game.

## Summary of Possible Outcomes

These are all of the possible end results for terminating the rift. This table does not include rewards given for intervening chapters.

| Chapter | Outcome |
|---|---|
| 7-A | - astral thread reward ( ~50, ~100, or ~150 ) based on the "time passed" variable which increments with some choices.<br>- Time Crystal relic.<br>- If leader species has the Latent Psionic trait, leader gains the Psychic trait. |
| 7-B | - large astral threads reward ( 140 , 150 , or 160 )<br>- Scientist dies. |

## Unique Mechanics

For this rift several chapters have a "right" choice that proceeds to the next chapter and a "wrong" choice that repeats the current one. The game silently tracks a variable for the "time passed" which is incremented each time a choice is made. If the time passed reaches a value of 3 then the **Time Crystal** outcome becomes impossible. If the rift ends with the **Time Crystal** outcome then the astral threads reward amount is a function of the time passed.

The fastest sequence of choices for the **Time Crystal** outcome is as follows:

- Blue button
- Pentagon button
- Six dots button

No more than one error can be made and still obtain the **Time Crystal** outcome, with the following exception: If the leader species is Toxoid or has the Aquatic or Waterproof trait then the **Time Crystal** outcome can still be reached after making 2 errors. Because the final astral threads reward is based on the time passed variable and not the number of chapters visited, the player can maximize the amount of astral threads received from the rift by intentionally selecting the "wrong choice" in **The Second Chamber** if Toxoid or in **The Third Chamber** if Aquatic or Waterproof.

## Chapter Detail

This is a detailed list of all chapters in this rift. The reward below each chapter name is issued when a selection is made, regardless of which one was chosen.

Options which indirectly force or preclude any final outcomes of the rift are noted in blue .

Chapters which terminate the rift are noted in red .

Because the order in which events are encountered depends on the player's choices, chapter numbers in this table may differ from the chapter numbers assigned to the events in-game. This table assigns chapter numbers based on the optimal progression of events (in which no errors are made), while the in-game rift dialog window will assign chapter numbers based on the order in which events are encountered. The names of chapters will always match exactly.
