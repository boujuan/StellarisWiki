# AI personalities

This page is about AI personality types. For general AI behavior and decision-making, see AI players .

AI empires act and behave based on their **AI personality** type, which in turn is dictated by factors like what ethics , traits and government type the empire has. The personality type will direct the empires' behavior in terms of foreign and domestic policy, fleet budgeting, political behavior and general empire characteristics. The empire's personality can be found in the diplomacy screen, just under the ethics list.

## Behavior modifiers

Behavior modifiers indicate the modification of certain common actions happening as compared to a generalized norm ( **1.0x** ).

- Aggressiveness – Affects the chance of declaring wars against empires they hold negative Attitude towards. Can be lowered or increased by the AI Aggressiveness game setting.
- Border friction – Affects how much negative Opinion Border Friction generates.
- Bravery - Affects how willing the empire is to declare rivalry or go to war with someone stronger. At 0.5 and below, they cannot declare war on empires considered Equivalent. At 1.5 and above, they can declare war on empires considered Superior. At 2.5 and above, they can declare war on empires considered Overwhelming.
- Colony spending – Affects how many resources the empire will spend in setting up new colonies.
- Claims concern - Affects how much negative Opinion Claims generate.
- Combat bravery - Affects the chance of retreating from battle. At **1.0** , they will attempt to retreat from an engagement after losing 50% of their fleet.
- Military spending – Affects how many resources the empire will spend on its fleets and armies.
- Threat concern – Affects how much negative Opinion Threat generates.
- Trade willingness – At **100%** willingness, the empire will accept a deal that is equally good for both sides. Lower values mean the empire will only accept deals shifted in its favor.

## Ships

These preferences determine how an empire designs its ships. They are ignored if the AI is facing an enemy heavily focused on a certain type of weapon or defense.

- Weapon preference - Preferred weapon type the AI personality will use on its ships when it has multiple components with similar fleet power available.
- Ship size preference - Preferred size of ships the AI personality will put in fleets.
- Hull ratio - Amount of utility slots used for hull boosters on ships.
- Armor ratio - Amount of utility slots used for armor on ships.
- Shields ratio - Amount of utility slots used for shields on ships.

As an example, an empire with **0.5x** Shield ratio and **0.5x** Armor ratio will design ships where the Utility slots will contain **50%** Shield and **50%** Armor components.

## AI personalities

When the game is started, the personality with the highest weight will be assigned to the empire. Any behavior modifier listed above that is not included in a given entry in the below table means its value is equal to the norm ( **1.0x** ).

Each personality is illustrated by a specific room during diplomacy. The room choice can be overridden in custom empire creation, however the personality's room will still display during first contact events. The empire that becomes Galactic Custodian or Galactic Emperor will change to an unique room.

Player empires are also assigned with AI personalities, and the personality's policy choices are defaulted to at the start of the game. Players can override any policies they wish as ethics allow. However, opinion bonuses and penalties with other empires will apply regardless of whether an empire is controlled by a player or not. This is especially obvious when the player empire is an Evangelizing Zealots, Honorbound Warriors, Democratic crusaders, Fanatical Befrienders, or Metalheads.

### Playable personalities

These personalities are available to any empires created through custom empire creation.
