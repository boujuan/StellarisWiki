# Console commands

**If you want to contribute to this page, which is a work in progress, in the console type "help" to see the list of commands, then to see a description and parameter of a command, type "help [command-name]", and put the corresponding details into the list.**

This page deals with commands used in the console. For the modding term, see effects .

This page lists the codes which may be input into the console window, a special debugging window which may be accessed on non-ironman games by pressing Shift+2, ALT+2+1, Shift+3, § , ~ , ^ , ° , ² , or ` (key varies based on keyboard layout). For a QWERTY keyboard, the key is ` . Else, try pressing Shift + Alt + C if none of the above worked. Press the up or down arrow keys to traverse through previously executed commands. Many codes can be turned off by repeating the command, but sometimes reloading the save or exiting the game is necessary. The console also comes with menus and buttons for the most common commands. Using any console command will disable achievements.

## IDs

Most IDs are predefined and can be found on the ID page. Species, leader, empire and pop IDs however are defined when the game is created and have to be found with the debugtooltip command.

- Species IDs can be read by hovering over a species in the species menu. Unless the starting system or galaxy were modded, the player's species will always be 1 for the founder species and 2 for the syncretic/cyborg/bio-trophy/prepatent species.
- Leader IDs can be read by hovering over a leader in the leaders or empire menus. Unless the starting system or galaxy were modded, the player's starting ruler will always be 0.
- Empire IDs can be read by hovering over an empire's flag in the contacts menu or its borders on the galaxy map. Unless the starting system or galaxy were modded, the player's empire will always be 0.
- Ship IDs can be read by hovering over a ship in the fleet window. Unless the starting system or galaxy were modded, the player's starting science ship will always be 0.
- Pop IDs can be read by hovering over a pop in the population tab. Alternatively using the add_pops command empty will list all pop IDs. Unless the starting system or galaxy were modded, the player's pops will always be 0 to 32.

Trait IDs can also be found by hovering over the trait in the debug window.

## Changing galactic imperium color

The color of the galactic imperium can be changed mid-game while playing as the galactic emperor by copying the following command combination into the console and replacing the color name: effect = { change_country_flag = { icon = { category = "special" file = "the_empire.dds" } background= { category = "backgrounds" file = "00_solid.dds" } colors={ "red" "red" "null" "null" } } }

The word red can be replaced by any color name to give a different color, such as dark_blue
