# Federation

This article is about in-game federation mechanics. For the DLC, see Federations (DLC) .

A **Federation** is a supranational alliance of space-faring civilizations. Federation members are allies that are affected by friendly auras . Federation members automatically defend each other in war as they would in a Defense Pact, but must agree to offensive wars as a group and have a unique system of Experience, Tiers, and Laws that differentiate Federations from other types of diplomatic pacts. Members also gain more general diplomatic benefits with each other to allow the Federation to act as a unit on the Galactic stage - members do not generate border friction amongst themselves, build trust with each other to a cap of +100 and share 10% of their victory score with each other. Players can set a name for their federation at creation or leave it random; the name can be changed at any time. If the union map view is toggled on, all Federation members share the same color.

Creating a federation requires either the The Federation tradition or the Federation Code technology. Federations may also be formed as a rebellion against the Galactic Imperium or as an option given shortly after a War in Heaven starts. An invited empire must have a positive acceptance score with an existing federation member for said member to vote for their addition. Hovering over the diplomatic choice will show which empires agree and disagree.

Members of a federation have their energy output reduced by −15% .

When a member leaves or is kicked from a federation, it gains a Truce with the federation.

Leaving a federation will grant a decaying −200 opinion with all federation members.

A federation is disbanded if it has only one or none members.

## Federation types

The federation type represents the founding ideals and wider goals of a Federation and its members, and determines what perks the federation provides at each level. The federation type can be changed at any time with a vote by clicking on the federation type icon. Changing the federation type, however, resets the federation level to 1.

The Galactic Union federation type is available by default, and all other federation types are only available with the Federations DLC and require the founding member to possess either a certain tradition tree finisher or a particular ethic , authority , or civic . Barbaric Despoilers empires can only create a Martial Alliance or Hegemony.

Empires with a Common Ground origin have the option to change their federation type to any but Hegemony depending on their ethics, authority, and civics.

Member modifiers apply to all federation members, including the president, with the sole exception for some of the modifiers applied by Hegemony federations.

## Cohesion

Cohesion is a measure of how unified a federation is and ranges from +100 to −100 . It has the following effects:

- Each 10 points of cohesion above **0** adds +1 XP per month to a federation, up to +10 at +100 cohesion.
- Each 10 points of cohesion below **0** adds −1 XP per month to a federation, up to −10 at −100 cohesion.
- Each 4 points of cohesion above **0** adds +1 acceptance for changing federation laws.
- Each 4 points of cohesion below **0** adds −1 acceptance for changing federation laws.
- Cohesion below 90 reduces the acceptance for increasing the Centralization Law by −50 .

The following incur **immediate** cohesion penalties:

- −100 whenever a member joins or leaves the federation, including when an empire integrates a subject that was also a member.
- −50 whenever the federation type changes
- −10 whenever the federation Centralization Law changes
- −5 whenever any other federation law changes
- −10 whenever a failed vote occurs

The following incur **monthly** cohesion penalties:

- −0.25 for each member of the federation
- −0.15 multiplied by the number of different ethics, minus 3 ( moderate and fanatic ethics of the same type will count as different ethics )
- −0.5 for each opposed ethics ( Two opposing fanatics, or any combination with only a single fanatic will only count for one set of opposed ethics. Normal and fanatic on one side, and fanatic or normal and fanatic on the other will count for two. )
- −100 for not having at least 2 members

Cohesion can only be increased by assigning an Official to the federation. Each leader level increases cohesion each month by +1 . AI empires will always assign an Official to the federation.

If a federation loses the experience required for a level and fails to raise it above the required limit within 90 days, the federation level will downgrade and remove all perks from the previously held level. A federation's experience is capped at 20,000XP .

## Federation fleet

Federations that have their Fleet Contribution law set to anything other than None feature a joint fleet, controlled by the current federation president, in addition to the forces of the separate member empires. Federation fleets cost no maintenance and use the federation fleet capacity, which every member contributes to based on the Fleet Contribution law, up to 600. The fleets cannot exceed this cap. The Entente Coordination tradition doubles the naval capacity contribution of the members that adopt it while not reducing their own further. The command limit of federation fleets is increased by the non repeatable technologies of federation members (repeatable technologies, civics, traditions and ascension perks are not taken into account).

The president designs the federation fleet ships via a special ship designer available in the federation menu and may use any technology available to any member empire. Regular ship designs cannot be used to build federation ships. The president's empire is responsible for commanding the federation fleets. Federation law determines whether any member of the federation or only the president's empire can build ships for the federation fleet. Any AI federation member's research of a component-unlocking technology will auto-update the default federation designs, but not any player-created ones, adding theirs to the list instead. Since their designs are considered newer, if you update your federation fleets at this time, your fleet will become their design, which can be undesirable.

If a federation is disbanded, so is the federation fleet.

The federation fleet has its own Titan limit of up to 4, which does not affect the number of Titans its members can construct individually.

If any federation member has the Artificial Breeding technology, space fauna can also be designed for federation fleets.

## Federation laws

Federation laws dictate how the federation operates and customize certain aspects of a federation. Any federation member can propose a law change. Hovering over any law will list the federation members that will support or oppose it. A failed vote adds −10 cohesion.

### Federation Centralization

Federation Centralization determines what Federation laws are available and is limited by the current federation level. Raising centralization will incur increasingly higher costs to cohesion. Enacting any option adds −10 cohesion.

| Option | Monthly cohesion | Member intel cap | Required level | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Minimal | **0** | +10 | 1 | The Federation's influence over its members is kept at a minimum. |
| Low | −1 | +20 | 2 | The level of Federation influence over member states are kept very low. |
| Medium | −2 | +30 | 3 | The Federation has a good deal of influence over its members, while still allowing some independent governing. |
| High | −3 | +40 | 4 | The Federation's influence over its member states is almost absolute. |
| Very High | −4 | +50 | 5 | The Federation has sovereign control over how member states are being governed. |

### Fleet Contribution

The Fleet Contribution law determines how much naval capacity is transferred from federation members to the federation fleet. The availability of this law is heavily affected by the federation type. Enacting any option other than None adds −5 cohesion.

| Option | Monthly cohesion | Transferred naval capacity | Federation fleet capacity | Required centralization | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Martial Alliance | Hegemony | Galactic Union | Trade League | Holy Covenant | Research Cooperative | | | | |
| **None** | **0** | 0 | 0 | Minimal | Minimal | Minimal | Minimal | Minimal | Minimal |
| **Low** | −0.25 | 10% | 200 | Minimal | Minimal | Low | Low | Medium | Medium |
| **Medium** | −0.5 | 20% | 400 | Low | Low | Medium | Medium | Very High | Very High |
| **High** | −0.75 | 30% | 600 | Medium | High | High | Very High | No | No |

#### Federation Fleet Construction

The Federation Fleet Construction law determines who can build ships for the federation fleet.

| Option | Effects | Required Centralization | DLC |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Everyone** | All members can build ships for the federation fleet | Minimal | |
| **Only Leader** | Only the federation president can build ships for the federation fleet | Low | |

### Succession Type

The Succession Type law determines how the next federation president is chosen once their term is up. Enacting any option other than Rotation adds −5 cohesion.

| Option | Monthly cohesion | Effects | Required centralization | DLC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Rotation** | −0.5 | Leadership is rotated among each Federation member | Minimal | |
| **Strongest** | −1 **0** if Hegemony | The empire with the highest succession power becomes the next president | High Minimal if Hegemony | |
| **Random** | **0** | The next president is chosen randomly | Minimal | |
| **Challenge** | **0** | The empire that wins the challenge becomes the next president | Low | |

#### Succession Power

If the Succession Type law is set to Strongest , then this law will define what criteria is used to determine which empire is "the strongest". This category is not visible with any other succession type. Enacting any option adds −5 cohesion.

| Option | Effects | DLC |
|---|---|---|
| **Economy** | Chooses the president based on economic power | |
| **Diplomatic Weight** | Chooses the president based on diplomatic weight | |
| **Technology** | Chooses the president based on technology level | |
| **Fleets** | Chooses the president based on fleet power | |

#### Challenges

If the Succession Type law is set to Challenge , then this law will define what the challenge for determining the next president will be. This category is not visible with any other succession type. Empires that are subjects or do not meet the challenge requirements will be forced to drop out from the competition.

| Challenge | Description | Empire drops out if |

This requires an amount of unity per owned planet, specifically, 600 (+0.15), 1800 (+0.3), or 5400 (+0.5). The second time there is also an option to pay Energy equal to the amount of pops in the empire to add +2 to the bribe value, but there is a 25% chance (set at the beginning of the conclave) for this option to add −0.5 instead. The total bribe value can thus vary between −0.5 and 2.5. The highest ranked empire becomes the new leader. | Factor |

## Joint operations

Once 60 years pass, if a federation has reached at least level 2 and is at peace, its president may be offered the choice to start a joint project with the other federation members. The joint project lasts 10 years and requires each member to individually complete a special project.

### Ephemeral Puzzle

**Galactic Union** and **Research Cooperative** federations have the objective of studying a space aurora. Each member is given a choice to start a special project above its capital starbase that requires a scientist in the capital system and 200 physics research.

Completing the special projects brings a choice to free or trap the cloud; either choice progresses the project, but affects which final outcome is received. The joint operation ends after 3 years, or completes when every participating member finishes the special project.

| Outcome | Federation effects | Member effects | Scope | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **All participating members freed the cloud** | +30 Cohesion | - Cloud's Boon empire modifier:<br>  - +10% Physics research<br>  - +5% Society research | Empire | 10 years |
| **Some participating members trapped the cloud and some freed it** | | - Dismembered Cloud empire modifier:<br>  - +10% Physics research | Empire | 6 years |
| **All participating members trapped the cloud** | +20 Cohesion | - A Cloud Ensnared planet modifier:<br>  - +10% Physics research<br>  - −5% Happiness<br>  - −20% Immigration pull | Capital | 4 years |

If the project was not completed, it can happen again after 20 years.

### Logistics Remodelling

**Trade League** federations have the objective of creating a shipping standard. Within two years, each member must generate at least 50 trade in an owned system.

After two years, all member empires gain −10% trade from jobs. Empires that succeeded gain +5% consumer goods and if they have a Offworld Trading Company in the system, their −10% trade from jobs modifier is reduced to −5% trade from jobs. Empires that succeeded are issued a special project on the system's starbase that requires a construction ship.

| Outcome | Member effects | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **Member failed to generate50trade in a system** | −10% Trade from jobs | Until the joint operation is complete |
| **Member generated50trade in a system** | - −10% Trade from jobs<br>- +5% Consumer goods | Until the joint operation is complete |
| - **Member generated50trade in a system**<br>- Offworld Trading Company present in the system | - −5% Trade from jobs<br>- +5% Consumer goods | Until the joint operation is complete |

Once each member completes the special project, all modifiers are removed and the joint operation is completed. The joint operation also ends if 15 years pass before all members complete their projects.

| Outcome | Effects | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| **All members participated** | - Participating members gain Fully Streamlined Logistics empire modifier:<br>  - +12% Trade from jobs | Permanent |
| **Not all members participated** | - Participating members gain Streamlined Logistics empire modifier:<br>  - +10% Trade from jobs | Permanent |
| **No members participated** | Federation loses 50 cohesion | |

### Joint Military Exercises

**Martial Alliance** federations have a federation-wide fleet exercise as their objective. Members that agree gain a temporary +50 opinion with the president while those that refuse gain −50 opinion with the president. If more than half of the members refuse, the federation loses 100 cohesion and the president loses 50 influence.

If at least half of the members agree, the president and all members that agreed are given a location in the Situation Log which they must reach with a fleet of at least 15 ships within 6 years. Once each member reaches the location, a hostile fleet of 5-9 ships appears for each participating member and must be defeated within 30 days. Once the fleets are defeated or not, the joint operation is completed.

Members succeed if they complete the project and destroy the hostile fleet before 30 days pass; they fail otherwise. Members who refused to participate also count as failing.

| Outcome | Federation effects | Member effects | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| **All members succeeded** | +100 Cohesion and +1000 experience | +15% Ship fire rate | 25 years |
| **More members succeeded than failed** | +50 Cohesion and +500 experience | +15% Ship fire rate | 25 years |
| **More members failed than succeeded** | −25 Cohesion | −15% Ship fire rate | 25 years |
| **No members succeeded** | −50 Cohesion | −15% Ship fire rate | 25 years |

This joint operation can be repeated once every 50 years.

### A Celebration of Unity and Leadership

**Hegemony** federations have the objective of building a monument. Members that agree gain temporary +100 opinion with the president, while those that refuse gain temporary −150 opinion with the president. Members which cannot access the president's capital system are not considered. If more than half of the members refuse, the federation loses 100 cohesion and the president loses 50 influence.

If at least half of the members agree, all members that agreed are issued a special project above the president's capital which requires a construction ship and takes a year to complete, while the president is issued a special project to give at most two members +35% attraction towards the president's ethics for 20 years, which requires a science ship and takes 6 months to complete. Any member that finishes the special project gains temporary +50 opinion with the president.

Once all member special projects are finished, the joint operation is completed.

| Outcome | Federation effects | President effects |
|---|---|---|
| **All members agreed and completed the special project** | +100 Cohesion +1000 experience | - Federation Monument on capital:<br>  - +0.5 Influence |
| **More members completed the project than didn't or refused** | +50 Cohesion +500 experience | - Federation Monument on capital:<br>  - +0.25 Influence |
| **Two or more members completed the project, but more didn't or refused** | +25 Cohesion +250 experience | |
| **No members completed the project** | −50 Cohesion | Loses 50 Influence. |
| **More than half members refused** | −100 Cohesion | |

If the monument is not completed (the president didn't gain the planetary feature), the project can happen again after 50 years, but only for a different president. A current project will be canceled if the federation president changes.

### Federation Ecumenical Council

**Holy Covenant** federations have the objective of creating a unified dogma. Within the next 300 days, each member will receive two events where they have an arrogant option (gain Influence and/or Unity or not pay anything) and a humble option (receive no reward or pay Influence and/or Energy). Depending on the event, certain civics will provide an additional option with increased benefits.

Each member is also given the option to assign a leader to the project for 300 days. Accepting counts as a humble option while refusing counts as an arrogant option.

- If the number of humble choices was greater than the number of arrogant choices, each member will gain +20% Unity from Jobs for 20 years and the federation will gain +3 Monthly Federation XP for 20 years.
- If the number of humble choices was equal to the number of arrogant choices, each member will gain +20% Unity from Jobs for 10 years and the federation will gain +3 Monthly Federation XP for 10 years.

Gestalt Consciousness empires cannot take part in the project and will not receive any rewards. This joint operation can be repeated once every 50 years.
