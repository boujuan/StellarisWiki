# On actions

## Introduction

Aside from the default polling another very common way to get an event triggered is on_action . The vanilla game itself has a number of events registered this way in Stellaris\common\on_actions\00_on_actions.txt

The situations of triggering range from polling less aggressive (monthly or yearly) to numerous developments of the galaxy like ending of a planetary invasion, survey, entering of a system and so forth. This is later part is comparable to registering an Event in a GUI Environment of many higher programming languages.

Most of the text before this line is way too unintelligible for a wiki. Putting whatever the author wanted to say in their language into google translator and pasting here the english translation would have certainly been better. Probably still not clear, but better. I'm sure the rest of the page will be worse, but I'll clown you just on this part because I had a tiring day.

Registered events should be marked with "triggered only" modifier. As easily dozens of events can be registered to any one development (often belonging to the same chain) the triggers decide which events are actually called.

## Custom On Actions

Since 3.0 you can define your own "on_actions" in script by effect fire_on_action = { on_action = <string> scopes = { from = X fromfrom = Y } } . Do note that when defining scopes, fire_on_action appears to be considered a scope and all non-event_target scopes require a prev added before them ( from = prev will scope to the scope firing the on_action, and to scope to the previous scope from = prevprev must be used instead). In addition, non-global event_targets will not be available in the fired events if the from scope is overwritten.

### Performance

For planet, system, starbase, leader and pop events, it's recommended to use pre_triggers (fast triggers that are checked before normal ones) to improve performance.

## Order of Events

When multiple events are registered to the same action, they will be fired in the order listed. If they are registered in multiple files, they are fired in ASCII-betical order. So, if you have a file aaa_on_actions.txt with on_game_start = { events = { event.1 event.2 } } and a file bbb_on_actions.txt with on_game_start = { event = { event.3 event.4 } } , then those events will be fired in the order event.1, event.2, event.3, event.4. The ID of the event has no effect.

## Firing Behavior

Every time an On Action gets fired, it will:

- Go through every single event in its events = {} block, exclude the ones that trigger false, and fire all the other events.
- Go through every single event in its random_events = {} block, exclude the ones that trigger false, roll weights, and fire one random valid event.
 - Unlike random_list = {} , random_events = {} don't support weight modifiers, but you can add a weight_multiplier = {} block to the event itself.

## List of Vanilla On Actions

| Name | Desc | Community Notes |
|---|---|---|
| on_game_start | Triggers when the game starts | |
| on_game_start_country | | |
| on_single_player_save_game_load | No scope, like on_game_start Does not run when loading MP saves due to OOS concerns | Border related triggers/effects do not work. |
| on_monthly_pulse | No scope, like on_game_start | |
| on_monthly_pulse_pre_ftl_observation | Via pre_ftl_tech_progress_situation / preftl.50 See also: on_monthly_pulse_pre_ftl_observation_broken_shackles (below) | |
| on_monthly_pulse_pre_ftl_observation_broken_shackles | The following are considered valid for "Broken Shackles" empires observing their original civilizations; see also on_monthly_pulse_pre_ftl_observation (above) Via pre_ftl_tech_progress_situation / preftl.50 | |

| on_decade_pulse | No scope, like on_game_start | |
| on_mid_game_pulse | No scope, like on_game_start | |
| on_late_game_pulse | No scope, like on_game_start | |
| on_monthly_pulse_country | this = country | Only country_types with has_pulse_events = yes will get these events. Notably, Fallen/Awakened Empires will not get these events. |
| on_yearly_pulse_country | this = country | Only country_types with has_pulse_events = yes will get these events. Notably, Fallen/Awakened Empires will not get these events. |
| on_bi_yearly_pulse_country | this = country | Only country_types with has_pulse_events = yes will get these events. Notably, Fallen/Awakened Empires will not get these events. |

| on_five_year_random_pulse_pre_ftl_tech_events | this = country, fired via action.630 | |
| on_five_year_random_pulse_country_negative_list | Why do this, you might ask, and not just use a random_list? Because on_actions check the triggers of the event before they try to fire them and exclude them from the list if they are false, so a list with no 0 weight will always fire an event so long as any of them are able to be fired Used in operation_diplomatic_incident. Beware when changing. this = country, fired via action.2211 from on_five_year_random_pulse_country | |
