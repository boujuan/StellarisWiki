# Caravaneers

The Caravaneers are a space-based coalition of traders who send out fleets across the galaxy to offer great deals to every empire that is not Genocidal. They start in a unique system called Chor’s Compass which contains their Caravaneer Citadel and two out of three caravan fleets: Racket Industrial Enterprise, the Numistic Order, and the Vengralian Trium. These fleets roam the galaxy, traveling towards every empire to offer deals.

## Chor's Compass

The Caravaneer Citadel in this System acts as the return point for the caravan fleets and an intergalactic Casino. Should the station be destroyed but at least one caravan fleet still be alive, they will ask to re-establish it in a random uncolonized system claimed by an empire, as close to their original one as possible. If the empire accepts it will lose control of the system but gain +5% Trade Value.

The Caravaneers use a unique resource called **CaravanCoinz** , which can be bought in bulks of 8k, 12k and 26k with Energy Credits. The options are equally efficient. Those can be used to either play Slots or open a Reliquary. Reliquaries restock every 500 days, but once they can be bought with energy credits they no longer have a cooldown.

| | Slots | Reliquary |
|---|---|---|
| Price | 2783.92 CaravanCoinz | 6194.21 CaravanCoinz After buying 6 Reliquaries they can be bought for 8450 Energy. Each Reliquary increases the cost by 5%. |

### The Collector

If an empire has a colony within 3 hyperlane jumps of the Caravaneer Citadel, each year there is a 2% chance of the empire being contacted by a caravaneer called The Collector and offered a mystery box for 3000 Energy. If bought, it will grant one of the following:

- 35% - Nothing
- 10% - 4000 Minerals
- 10% - 1000 Engineering
- 10% - 1000 Society
- 10% - 1000 Physics
- 10% - 1000 Alloys
- 5% - Alloy Hyperfabricator capital world modifier (can only happen once)
- 5% - Energy Accelerator capital world modifier (can only happen once)
- 5% - Incredibly Boring Relic capital world modifier (can only happen once)

## Caravans

Every time a Caravan fleet enters an empire's borders, it will offer a rare trade deal. The offer can be accepted immediately, delayed to when the fleet is leaving the space, or rejected outright. The fleets can not be contacted any other way, and all attempts will redirect to Chor's Compass instead. Delaying has a very low chance of the deal changing.

Certain random events can take place while a Caravan is within an empire's borders.

### Numistic Order

The Numistic Order is a religious Caravan that offers only deals with fixed costs. It features the largest amount of offers, but half of them are one time only. They offer the following deals:

### Vengralian Trium

The Vengralian Trium is unique in that both their products and their prices are randomly generated, as opposed to each product having a specific price. Their deals may contain any of the following:

| Offers | Prices |
|---|---|
| - 2000 Energy Credits ( Gestalt Consciousness)<br>- 1000 Consumer Goods (not Gestalt Consciousness unless Rogue Servitor)<br>- 1 Trium Atmospheric Deodorizer Deployment decision (not Gestalt Consciousness)<br>- 1 Trium Bunk Beds Deployment decision<br>- 1 Trium Food Container Deployment decision<br>- +15% Trade Value for 80 years (not Gestalt Consciousness)<br>- +10% Pop Growth Speed for 10 years ( Hive Mind) | - 1200 Alloys<br>- 500 Unity<br>- 400 Specialist Pops (not Gestalt Consciousness)<br>- 400 Pops, don't have to be drones ( Gestalt Consciousness)<br>- −100% Society Research for 6 months<br>- 1 Science Ship |

### Racket Industrial Enterprise

Rackets are the only predefined Caravaneer species, using the same portraits and traits as the Ketling Star Pack . The payment options for this Fleet are randomly generated based on the product offered, although Gestalt Consciousness empires are never asked for Consumer Goods. They offer the following deals:

| Offer | Price | Requirements |

## Attacking the Caravaneers

While the Caravaneers will never become hostile to any empire except in retaliation, they can be attacked like any neutral entity. If a Caravan is attacked, it will become hostile, but the rest of the Caravaneers will remain peaceful and available for trade. Caravans have 4k fleet power and come equipped with mid-game components. The Caravaneer Citadel on the other hand has 7k fleet power and comes equipped with end-game components. Both Caravans and the Caravaneer Citadel grant 2000 Energy and Minerals when destroyed, and if the attacking fleet was led by a Commander, they will gain the Caravan Counter trait. Destroying the Caravaneer Citadel brings a temporary −80 Opinion from all empires that had contact with the Caravaneers and are Pacifist, Xenophile or Corporate and +80 Opinion from all empires that had contact with the Caravaneers and are Xenophobe.
