# Council

The **council** represents the leadership of the empire , made up of the empire ruler and up to 5 other councilors. A leader can be appointed to each council position to provide empire-wide bonuses that scale with the leader's skill level. The council is also where agendas are launched, producing additional empire-wide effects.

## Council positions

Most council position require the leader to be a specific leader class . Each position can be renamed by clicking on its name.

### Ruler

Every empire has a single leader acting as the empire ruler. The ruler provides +5 edict fund per skill level, as well as a unique effect that depends on empire authority. Ruler is the only council position that a leader cannot be freely assigned to or unassigned from.

In most governments, the ruler is changed through elections . The default ruler title and the leader class favored in elections are determined by the government type . In Imperial governments, the ruler is succeeded by the Imperial Heir instead, and in Gestalt Consciousness governments, the ruler is immortal and permanent.

The empire's other effects and the election type are determined by the empire authority .

Some advanced authorities replace the original authority's ruler skill effect. Advanced authorities not listed here keep the original authority's effect.

| Authority | Effects per skill level | Advanced authority effects per skill level | |
|---|---|---|---|
| All authorities | +5 Edict fund | | |
| Democratic | +2% Faction resource output | | |

| Machine Intelligence | −3% Empire size from pops | | |

### Minister positions

Each non-gestalt empire starts with three (or in some cases two) initial council positions alongside the empire ruler. Each of them requires a leader to be a specific leader class. If these positions are not filled or absent from the council, their absence applies an empire-wide penalty.

| Position | Effects per skill level | Required class | Penalty if absent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minister of Defense | - −2% Ship upkeep<br>- −2% Army upkeep<br>- Upkeep −2% Starbase upkeep | Commander | −25% Naval capacity |

Empires with the Inward Perfection or Fanatic Purifiers civic do not have the Minister of State position, and cannot unlock it at any point.

### Nodes

Gestalt Consciousness empires use four permanent nodes instead of council positions. The nodes level up together with the ruler and can have their own traits. If the Galactic Paragons DLC is active, they will also obtain a council-focused veteran class once they reach skill level 4, although the class itself will not have any effects.

| Node | Effects per skill level | Class | Veteran class | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Regulatory Node | −3 Deviancy | Official | Ambassador | The Regulatory Node is where we counter the emergence of deviant consciousnesses. |

## Additional council positions

Individualist empires can unlock two additional council positions with the Expand The Council agenda, which can be launched once at any time, and a second time after Galactic Administration has been researched. Empires with the Inward Perfection or Fanatic Purifiers civic will start the game with their civic position unlocked in place of the Minister of State.

Council positions can be reselected by reforming the government or by launching the Reorganize Council agenda. This will also reset the position slots held by starting council positions, which will apply the penalty unless the position is selected again.

## Agendas

An Agenda represents the current strategic focus of the Council, shaping the empire's priorities and long-term goals. Each agenda has a weaker continuous effect and a far more powerful launch effect which takes time to prepare and once ready lasts for 10 years, or 12.5 if the empire has the Immutable Directives tradition. Agendas can be changed at any point, but if they are not ready for launch all progress will be lost. After an agenda is launched, the same agenda cannot be selected again for 30 years.

Agendas cost 7000 progress points to launch, and the cost is increased by 0.1% for each point of empire size above 100. Each councilor provides 10 + level points of progress each month. Agendas can be launched by paying unity equal to the amount of progress left.

The council also has a council legitimacy rating based on the total faction approval within the empire. Each point below 50% decreases monthly agenda progress by −1% and each point above 50% increases progress by +0.5% .
