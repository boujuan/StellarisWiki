# Civics

Standard civics represent the foundational principles and societal structures that define an empire and are primarily limited by the authority and ethics an empire possesses. Each empire starts with up to two civics, and this limit is increased to three civics by researching the Galactic Administration technology. Civics can be changed every 20 years by reforming the government spending 10 unity per empire size. If a civic selected at empire creation unlocks or replaces a building, that building will be added to the homeworld.

If at any point a civic's requirements are no longer met due to a change in empire ethics or authority, it becomes inactive and provides no bonus until it is replaced or its requirements are met again. Buildings from an inactive civic remain functional but new ones cannot be constructed. Council positions from an inactive civic remain functional but if the slot is unlocked later they cannot be selected. All civic buildings are removed at the beginning of the next month if their civic is removed. Leader traits granted by civics are not lost if the civic is removed. Reforming the government while a civic is inactive requires removing it unless the civic is a permanent one.

Knowing another empire's civics requires Medium Intel on Government. Genocidal civics are always revealed.

If the Galactic Paragons DLC is enabled, each civic also unlocks a council position.

If the Shadows of the Shroud DLC is enabled, most civics also give +60 Attunement with a certain Shroud patron.

Empires that finish the Fear of the Dark origin story either way will gain an additional civic slot.

Sovereign civics are not inherited by sectors released as vassals or systems created by status quos and they are lost if the empire loses a war against an empire using the Ideology casus belli. If the Galactic Paragons DLC is installed each civic will unlock a council position.
