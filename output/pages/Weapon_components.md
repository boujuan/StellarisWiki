# Weapon components

Weapon components are devices that can be attached to military ships and are used to attack, damage and destroy other ships, specifically any ships that have been designated as valid targets.

## Overview

A weapon has the following stats:

- Cost: How many resources the weapon requires in order to be built and operated.
- Power usage: How much power the weapon will consume when installed.
- Type: What category of weapons this particular weapon belongs to.
- Damage: How much damage the weapon will deal per hit if it hits its target at 100% efficiency.
- Cooldown: After attacking, every weapon has a mandatory time delay it has to go through before it can attack again.
- Accuracy: The base chance of the weapon hitting a target, assuming the target has 0% evasion. Certain weapons are easier to aim than others.
- Tracking: How much of the target's evasion the weapon will ignore when firing at its target. If this value is higher than the target's evasion value, the weapon will enjoy base accuracy.
- Range: The maximum and minimum distance the weapon can be used at. A target must be within this firing range in order for a weapon to be able to engage it.
- Average damage: How much damage the weapon will deal per in-game day, assuming the target has no evasion.
- Damage modifiers: How effective the weapon is against a given type of defense.

Most weapons come in multiple sizes. As a rule of thumb, larger sizes usually have lower Tracking tracking, but greater weapons range, damage per hit and damage per day, while smaller sizes conversely have higher Tracking tracking but lesser weapons range and damage output. This means that larger weapons are generally more effective against larger, slower ships, and smaller weapons are more effective against smaller, evasive ships.

Strategic Resource Edicts: Strategic Resources enable Strategic Resource Edicts, which include military edicts that can boost weapon or defense systems. Strategic Resources can thus increase the effective damage of key weapons in the early game for a decisive edge in key battles. Lithoid Empires can begin the game with access to any one strategic resource on the Market via their Silicate traits, while normal organics can only have access to Exotic Gas via the Inorganic Breath trait as part of the Toxoids DLC. Weapon and defense types to resource include:

- Rare Crystals: Energy Weapons, Sensor Range
- Volatile Motes: Kinetic Weapons, Explosive Weapons, Armor
- Exotic Gases: Shields, Sublight Speed

Archaeotech Weapons: As of Patch 3.7, the Ancient Relics DLC also introduces Archaeotech Weapons, which are unlocked by the Archaeotech Society Research tree. Archaeotech weapons are generally slightly stronger than Tier 3 equivalent weapons, but with special mechanical rules or modifiers that make them better or worse in different situations. All Archaeotech weapons receive +33% weapon damage with the Archaeo-Engineering Ascension perk, and +15% weapon damage with the Rubricator relic, which makes them close to Tier 5 weapons in power. Archaeotech weapons can thus be powerful, but limited due to expense of Minor Artifact cost. Note that Menacing ships unlocked by Becoming the Crisis do not pay component special resource costs due to their mineral cost dynamic.

### Mechanical vs. Biological Variants

Depending on whether an empire uses Mechanical or Biological ships, their weapon components will have different stats. In general, biological -slot weapons have a shorter range but deal greater damage than their mechanical counterparts, -slot weapons are usually the same as the equivalent mechanical component, and and slot weapons generally have longer cooldowns, reduced range, and/or reduced damage to balance the fact that Stinger bioships can carry a greater number of these slots than mechanical battleships. Biological Hangar weapons launch twice as many strike craft, but each craft deals half as much damage for the same overall DPS, and biological strike craft have reduced health and use armor instead of shields.

Additionally, there are some weapons that are exclusive to mechanical or biological ships. Only empires with mechanical ships can research regular missiles and torpedoes, while only biological ship empires can use mandibles or weaver weapons.

## Energy weapons

Based on Physics technology, energy weapons use energy-based attacks and are generally effective against armor and hull but ineffective against shields. Energy weapons can be divided into four categories: anti-armor, anti-hull, anti-shield and penetrating.

Energy weapons generally have slightly better accuracy, lower damage and shorter range compared to kinetic weapons. Advanced energy weapons require Rare Crystals and Exotic Gases to build and operate. Because energy weapons are both anti-hull and anti-armor, and will target non-shielded ships if able, it can be advantageous to have a bias of more energy weapons than anti-shield weapons over your fleet of ships.

### Anti-armor

Standard energy weapons are effective against armor, moderately effective against hull and ineffective against shields. Lasers, plasma launchers and lances belong to this category.

#### Laser

Lasers are the basic energy weapon. They fire focused beams of super-concentrated light at targets, causing damage through the generation of intense heat. They are effective against armor and hull but are ineffective against shields. Compared to other weapons, they trade strength for versatility, sporting an average range with no minimum, no extreme strengths or crippling weaknesses, and average damage output.

#### Ancient Cavitation Collapser

This is an archaeotech weapon. Damage will be increased by 33% with the Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk, and 15% with the Rubricator relic.

While sharing identical Cooldown, Range, and Tracking stats with Lasers, it has an additional 25% damage effectiveness against armor, and lacks the 25% damage against hull. However, due to ignoring 50% armor, it can begin applying damage directly to hull earlier, which slows down a vessel's fire rate. Due to higher tier armor components providing more armor points than the vessel has hull, this can allow Cavitation Collapsers to destroy later-game ships before their armor fails. This is exceptionally expensive in minor artifacts, but is more affordable with Menacing ships.

- Can fit into Small, Medium and Large slots
- **90%** accuracy
- 50% damage against Shield shield
- 150% damage against Armor armor
- 50% penetration against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Cooldown | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ancient Cavitation Collapser | | 17 8 | 15 | 11.5–31 (21.25) | 4.25 | 0–40 | 50% | 4.50 |
| | 34 10 | 30 | 28.75–75 (51.88) | 5.00 | 0–60 | 30% | 9.33 | |
| | 68 12 | 60 | 69–186 (127.5) | 5.70 | 0–80 | 5% | 20.13 | |
| Ancient Cavitation Collapser (biological) | | 17 8 | 15 | 14–38 (26.0) | 4.25 | 0–20 | 50% | 5.62 |
| | 34 10 | 30 | 28.75–75 (51.88) | 5.00 | 0–60 | 30% | 9.33 | |
| | 68 12 | 60 | 69–186 (127.5) | 11.40 | 0–80 | 5% | 10.06 | |

#### Plasma launchers

Plasma launchers launch balls of highly energized and destructive plasma. They are extremely effective against armor and very effective against hull, but highly ineffective against shields. Compared to standard lasers, they trade versatility for strength, with more extreme damage modifiers and slightly higher power draw.

- Can fit into Small, Medium and Large slots
- **80%** accuracy
- 25% damage against Shield shield
- 200% damage against Armor armor
- 150% damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Cooldown | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plasma Thrower | | 17 | 13 | 12–33 (22.5) | 5.00 | 0–40 | 40% | 3.6 |
| | 34 | 27 | 30–83 (56.5) | 5.70 | 0–60 | 20% | 7.92 | |
| | 68 | 63 | 72–198 (135.0) | 6.40 | 45–80 | 5% | 16.87 | |
| Plasma Accelerator | | 17 0.25 | 17 | 16–43 (29.5) | 5.00 | 0–40 | 40% | 4.72 |
| | 34 0.50 | 36 | 40–108 (74.0) | 5.70 | 0–60 | 20% | 10.38 | |
| | 68 1.00 | 82 | 96–258 (177.0) | 6.40 | 45–80 | 5% | 22.12 | |
| Plasma Cannon | | 22 0.33 | 23 | 21–56 (38.5) | 5.00 | 0–40 | 40% | 6.16 |
| | 44 0.65 | 47 | 53–140 (96.5) | 5.70 | 0–60 | 20% | 13.54 | |
| | 88 1.30 | 107 | 126–336 (231.0) | 6.40 | 45–80 | 5% | 28.87 | |

As with lasers, Small bio-plasma launchers deal more damage with a shorter range than mechanical ones, are the same, and Large bio-plasma launchers have a longer cooldown.

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Cooldown | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bio-Plasma Thrower | | 17 | 13 | 15-41 (28.0) | 5.00 | 0–20 | 40% | 4.50 |
| | 34 | 27 | 30–83 (56.5) | 5.70 | 0–60 | 20% | 7.92 | |
| | 68 | 63 | 72–198 (135.0) | 12.75 | 45–80 | 5% | 8.47 | |

| | 44 0.65 | 47 | 53–140 (96.5) | 5.70 | 0–60 | 20% | 13.54 | |
| | 88 1.30 | 107 | 126–336 (231.0) | 12.75 | 45–80 | 5% | 14.49 | |

#### Lances

Lances are heavy energy weapons that fire large, focused beams of highly energized particles and cause massive damage. Essentially a hybrid between lasers and plasma launchers, they are extremely effective against armor and very effective against hull but are ineffective against shields. Lances are unique as unlike most long-range weapons, they do not have a minimum range.

- Can fit into Extra-Large slots
- **9.95** day cooldown
- **85%** accuracy
- **25°** firing arc
- 50% damage against Shield shield
- 200% damage against Armor armor
- 150% damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Particle Lance | | 176 2.60 | 200 | 600–1500 (1050.0) | 0–150 | 0% | 89.69 |
| Tachyon Lance | | 229 3.38 | 260 | 780–1950 (1365.0) | 0–150 | 0% | 116.60 |

The Bioship equivalent of Lances are called Beams. Compared to Lances, Beams have a longer cooldown, a shorter range, and deal less damage, likely to compensate for the greater number of slots on Stingers.

- **14.90** day cooldown

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Particle Beam | | 176 2.60 | 200 | 480-1200 (690) | 0–120 | 0% | 47.91 |
| Tachyon Beam | | 229 3.38 | 260 | 624-1560 (1092) | 0–120 | 0% | 62.29 |

### Anti-hull

Energy weapons that are specialized in dealing damage to a ship's hull. As ships take hull damage, their fire rate slows, and they may withdraw if below 50% hull. Cutting lasers, launchers and Matter Disintegrators belong to this category.

#### Cutting Laser

Salvaged from ancient mining drones, these weapons use strong-focus lenses in combination with an oscillating firing frequency to create lasers strong enough to allow them to mine asteroids, or mine ships, destroying them.

They are highly effective against hull and armor but are ineffective against shields. They compare favorably to other energy weapons unlocked with T2 technology, but are mostly outclassed by the Tier 3 energy weapons. As an alternative to Plasma Throwers guaranteed by debris, they provide an early-game advantage by allowing you to invest early Physics research into ship components other than the Laser line while still having an energy weapon option.

In the early game, the Cutting Laser can combo particularly well with the Energy Siphon on early corvettes or destroyers. Both space fauna weapons are guaranteed research options slightly more powerful than their Tier 2 counterparts, meaning they can allow early tech research to prioritize other ship systems or economic techs while being available for research later for a military buildup if needed. As energy weapons, both weapons can also benefit from the +25% Energy Weapon damage Focusing Crystal strategic weapon edict that uses Rare Crystals, which Lithoids can start the game with via the Scintillating Skin trait.

Biological Cutting Lasers are called Mining Beam Projectors. As with other lasers, the Small Mining Beam Projector deals greater damage over a shorter range than the Small Mining Laser, but the Medium variants are identical.

- Can fit into Small and Medium slots
- 50% damage against Shield shield
- 150% damage against Armor armor
- 150% damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Cooldown | Range | Accuracy | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cutting Laser | | 13 | 7 | 8–21 (14.5) | 2.30 | 0–30 | 75% | 40% | 4.72 |
| | 26 | 17 | 20–53 (36.5) | 3.40 | 0–40 | 70% | 20% | 7.51 | |
| Mining Beam Projector | | 13 | 7 | 10-26 (14.5) | 2.30 | 0–15 | 75% | 40% | 5.91 |
| | 26 | 17 | 20–53 (36.5) | 3.40 | 0–40 | 70% | 20% | 7.51 | |

#### Particle launchers

These weapons fire projectile-like energy packets carrying an explosive payload of tightly concentrated protons or neutrons, capable of causing immense damage to the hull of enemy ships. Unlike most G slot weapons, these are not missiles, and so the projectiles have no travel time and cannot be shot down by point defense.

They are extremely effective against hull and very effective against armor but are ineffective against shields. Compared to other energy weapons, launchers trade damage and versatility for a powerful alpha-strike, doing immense damage per shot from a long range, but having relatively low sustained damage output against anything smaller than a battleship, and a significant minimum range.

The Bioship equivalent of Particle Launchers are called Particle Throwers and they are statistically identical.

- **21.25** day cooldown
- **75%** accuracy
- **25°** firing arc
- 50% damage against Shield shield
- 150% damage against Armor armor
- 175% damage against hull
- Additional multiplicative damage based on 100% of the target's ship size
 - Total Damage = (Ship Size + 1) * Base Damage

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Proton Launchers, Proton Throwers | | 88 1.30 | 59 | 47–101 (74) | 45–120 | 0% | 2.61 |
| Neutron Launchers , Neutron Throwers | | 114 1.69 | 77 | 61–131 (96) | 45–120 | 0% | 3.38 |

#### Zro Launcher

Zro Launcher are shroud weapons. Their damage does not increase as much against larger ships as usual for torpedos, but they partially ignore shield and armor to hit the hull directly. The organic variant, Zro Pods, is identical in stats.

- Can fit into Torpedo Slot
- **21.25** day cooldown
- **75%** accuracy
- 50% damage against Shield shield
- 150% damage against Armor armor
- 50% penetration against Shield shield and Armor armor

- Additional multiplicative damage based on 50% of the target's ship size
 - Total Damage = (Ship Size * 0.5 + 1) * Base Damage

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zro Launcher, Zro Pods | | 148 1 | 118 | 130-280 (155) | 45–120 | 0% | 7.29 |

#### Matter Disintegrator

Salvaged from Extradimensional Invaders , Matter Disintegrators work by applying 5th-dimensional energy manipulation principles on lower dimensional planes to create highly powerful energy shots. Similar to Plasma Launchers, Matter Disintegrators have relatively short range, are very effective against hull and armor, but are very ineffective against shields. They also deal slightly more damage to larger ships. Biological ships use the same Matter Disintegrator as mechanical ships.

- Can fit into Small, Medium and Large slots
- **4.25** day cooldown
- **90%** accuracy
- 25% damage against Shield shield
- 150% damage against Armor armor
- 150% damage against hull
- Additional multiplicative damage based on 10% of the target's ship size
 - Total Damage = (1 + 0.1 * Ship Size) * Base Damage

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Matter Disintegrator | | 29 0.43 | 25 | 20–49 (34.5) | 0–30 | 60% | 7.30 |
| | 57 0.85 | 40 | 50–123 (86.5) | 0–50 | 30% | 18.31 | |
| | 114 1.69 | 80 | 120–294 (207.0) | 0–70 | 5% | 43.83 | |

### Penetrating

Exotic energy weapons that ignore shields and armor completely, dealing damage directly to the hull. Their potential damage per shot is very high but is also highly unpredictable. Due to any non-penetrating weapons having to defeat all shields and armor before contributing to hull damage, it is recommended to have a fleet of pure penetrating weapons or none at all. Disruptors, Cloud Lightning and Arc Emitters belong to this category.

These weapons fire bolts of unstable and chaotic high-energy particles that damage and destroy the molecular bonds holding the target's constituent atoms together. The unstable and chaotic nature of the fired energy bolts allows them to slip right through both shields and armor to wreak havoc directly on the ship's hull and crew, but it also causes their damage output to be highly unpredictable.

#### Disruptor

Disruptors fire energy bolts that damage and destroy the molecular bonds holding the target's constituent atoms together. They completely ignore shields and armor and deal base damage directly to the hull. Unlike most weapons, they get less efficient when used in larger slots.

- Can fit into Small and Medium slots
- **100%** accuracy
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- **100%** damage against Armor armor
- 100% penetration against Shield shield and Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Cooldown | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Disruptor | | 17 | 10 | 1–11.2 (6.1) | 2.30 | 0–30 | 60% | 2.65 |
| | 34 | 23 | 1–28 (14.5) | 3.40 | 0–40 | 35% | 4.26 | |
| Ion Disruptor | | 17 0.25 | 13 | 1–14.7 (7.85) | 2.30 | 0–30 | 60% | 3.41 |
| | 34 0.50 | 30 | 1–37 (19.0) | 3.40 | 0–40 | 35% | 5.58 | |
| Phased Disruptor | | 22 0.33 | 17 | 1–19 (10.0) | 2.30 | 0–30 | 60% | 4.34 |
| | 44 0.65 | 39 | 1–48 (24.5) | 3.40 | 0–40 | 35% | 7.20 | |

Biological disruptors are referred to as Molecular Disruptors. Small Molecular Disruptors deal greater damage at a shorter range, while Medium ones are identical to mechanical Disruptors.

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Cooldown | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Molecular Disruptor | | 17 | 10 | 1–14 (7.5) | 2.30 | 0–15 | 60% | 3.31 |
| | 34 | 23 | 1–28 (14.5) | 3.40 | 0–40 | 35% | 4.26 | |
| Ion Molecular Disruptor | | 17 0.25 | 13 | 1–18 (9.5) | 2.30 | 0–15 | 60% | 4.26 |
| | 34 0.50 | 30 | 1–37 (19.0) | 3.40 | 0–40 | 35% | 5.58 | |
| Phased Molecular Disruptor | | 22 0.33 | 17 | 1–23 (12.0) | 2.30 | 0–15 | 60% | 5.43 |
| | 44 0.65 | 39 | 1–48 (24.5) | 3.40 | 0–40 | 35% | 7.20 | |

#### Psionic Disruptor

Psionic Disruptors are shroud weapons and work in a very similar way as default disruptors. They additionally inject a modifier into enemy ships that reduces their rate of fire. A ship can only be affected by one injected modifier at once.

#### Cloud Lightning

Salvaged from Void Clouds, this weapon is essentially a scaled-up Disruptor that use a special gas composition together with a specialized conduit to emit powerful lightning bursts. They ignore both shields and armor and deal base damage directly to the hull. However, even compared to basic Disruptors, Cloud Lightning does much less damage for an equivalent number of slots, and the only upside is a small increase in range.

- Can fit into Large slots
- **7.15** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- **100%** damage against Armor armor
- 100% penetration against Shield shield and Armor armor

#### Arc Emitter

A scaled-up version of the Cloud Lightning, itself a scaled-up version of the Disruptor, these weapons launch lightning arcs of chaotic and unstable energy at targets, ignoring armor and shields. They ignore both shields and armor and deal base damage directly to the hull. Unlike Cloud Lightning, Arc Emitters are much more efficient compared to an equivalent number of disruptor slots and are tied for the longest-range weapons in the game, making them significantly more viable.

- Can fit into Extra-Large slots
- **10.1** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy
- **35°** firing arc
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- **100%** damage against Armor armor
- 100% penetration against Shield shield and Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Arc Emitter | | 176 2.60 | 200 | 1–1300 (650.5) | 10–150 | 0% | 64.40 |
| Focused Arc Emitter | | 229 3.38 | 260 | 2–1690 (846.0) | 10–150 | 0% | 83.76 |

As with the Lances, the biological version of the Arc Emitter, called the Lightning Emitter, deals less damage over a shorter range and has a longer cooldown.

- **15.10** day cooldown

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lightning Emitter | | 176 2.60 | 200 | 1–1040 (520.5) | 10–120 | 0% | 34.47 |

### Anti-shield

Energy weapons that specialize in dealing damage to shields at the expense of their damage output against armor and hull. Related technologies can only be obtained from events or salvages.

#### Energy Siphon

Based on Society technology, this weapon drains energy from enemy ships by adapting the Tiyanki method of siphoning energy from gaseous matter.

They are extremely effective against shields but extremely ineffective against armor. Due to their low damage they are almost strictly outclassed by small coilguns against hull, but their marginally higher range and higher shield-damage modifier means that even a single per vessel in a fleet can quickly expose smaller Corvettes or Destroyers to more dedicated anti-armor and anti-hull weapons. As a guaranteed Society research option following First Contact, they can provide an early-game military advantage by allowing the Engineering tree to research military technologies other than coilguns while leveraging Society research for the early-game anti-shield role.

In the early game, the Energy Siphon can combo particularly well with the Mining Laser on early Corvettes or Destroyers. Both space fauna weapons are guaranteed research options slightly more powerful than their Tier 2 counterparts, meaning they can allow early tech research to prioritize other ship systems or economic techs while being available for research later for a military buildup if needed. As energy weapons, both weapons can also benefit from the +25% Energy Weapon damage Focusing Crystal strategic weapon edict that uses Rare Crystals, which Lithoids can start the game with via the Scintillating Skin trait.

- Can fit into Small slots
- **4.25** day cooldown
- **75%** accuracy
- 200% damage against Shield shield
- 25% damage against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Accuracy | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Energy Siphon | | 15 | 7 | 8–21 (14.5) | 0–60 | 75% | 50% | 2.55 |

#### Null Void Beam

Can be learned from the null void (a possible outcome of the **The Doorway** event chain ), this weapon possesses the unique ability to destroy energy by harnessing the entropic nature of the null void.

It has some of the longest ranges for its weapon size, all but ensuring they are the first weapons engaged on a target or allowing smaller variants to complement larger primary weapons. It is absurdly effective against shields but highly ineffective against both armor and hull. A few Null Void Beams in a fleet can allow a higher percentage of weapon slots to be dedicated to anti-armor and anti-hull weapons that are typically stopped by shields.

- Can fit into Small, Medium and Large slots
- **90%** accuracy
- 500% damage against Shield shield
- 25% damage against Armor armor
- 25% damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Cooldown | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Null Void Beam | | 13 | 7 | 6–16 (11.0) | 4.25 | 0–60 | 60% | 2.32 |
| | 26 | 13 | 15–40 (27.5) | 5.00 | 0–90 | 30% | 4.95 | |
| | 52 | 26 | 36–95 (65.5) | 5.70 | 0–120 | 5% | 10.34 | |

## Kinetic weapons

Based on Engineering technology, kinetic weapons use various means of propulsion (such as electromagnets, electromagnetic coils, and electromagnetic rails) to accelerate and fire solid projectiles. They're good against shields but poor against armor.

Kinetic weapons generally have slightly lower accuracy, higher damage and longer range compared to energy weapons, making them a good complement to energy weapons. Advanced kinetic weapons require Volatile Motes to build.

### Mass drivers

Mass drivers are the basic kinetic weapons. These projectile launchers use various systems of electromagnets to accelerate and fire solid armor-piercing projectiles towards targets at high speeds. They are very effective against shields but very ineffective against armor. Compared to other weapons, mass drivers are a jack of all trades – they have average range, no extreme strengths or weaknesses to difference defense types, and low damage.

- Can fit into Small, Medium and Large slots
- **75%** accuracy
- 150% damage against Shield shield
- 50% damage against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| | 88 1.30 | 59 | 96–276 (186.0) | 4.25 | 45–100 | 5% | 32.82 | |

Biological Mass Drivers are called Shard Accelerators. Small Shard Accelerators deal more damage but have a shorter range than mechanical ones, Medium ones are identical, and have a longer cooldown.

### Ancient Macro Batteries

This is an archaeotech weapon. Damage will be increased by 33% with the Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk, and 15% with the Rubricator relic.

This weapon is 33% less accurate than the mass driver kinetic weapon line ( 50% accuracy is two-thirds of 75% accuracy), but has 50% longer range than mass driver kinetic weapons. L-slot Macro Batteries also have 25% longer range compared to kinetic artillery and no minimum range.

While the lack of minimum range may seem like L-slot Macro Batteries are suitable for short-range ambushes, their abysmal accuracy severely cuts into their damage output and burst damage potential, especially against smaller targets with high evasion like corvettes and destroyers where their low tracking also comes into play. Dedicated short-range weapons like autocannons, disruptors, and torpedoes are far better for these types of ambushes.

They are instead far more useful for their very long range: L-slot Macro Batteries in particular match the range of X-slot weapons, are only outranged by the Perdition Beam weapon that is exclusive to Titans and Ion Cannons, and do not have the same narrow firing arcs that X- and T-slot weapons have on battleships and titans. With enough ship weapons range bonus modifiers, L-slot Macro Batteries can outrange every single weapon in the game, and given enough sublight speed, ships using them can outkite every single ship in the game.

- Can fit into Small, Medium and Large slots
- **50%** accuracy
- 150% damage against Shield shield
- 50% damage against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Cooldown | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |

| | 68 12 | 51 | 62–186 (124) | 4.25 | 0–150 | 5% | 14.58 | |

The biological variant, the Ancient Macro Shard Battery, deals greater damage than the mechanical variant at all sizes, but the Small size has a much shorter range and the Large size has a longer cooldown.

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Cooldown | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| | 68 12 | 51 | 72-210 (141) | 8.5 | 0–150 | 5% | 8.29 | |

### Autocannon

Autocannons are smaller, rapid-fire versions of the Mass Drivers that fire very small solid projectiles at a very rapid rate. Their main advantage is their extremely high damage output, but they are limited by high power usage, low range, and low damage against armor. They are very effective against shields, fairly effective against hull and severely ineffective against armor. Their extremely short range but high DPS makes them well suited for ambush tactics such as loitering near the entry points of systems.

Due to how the game calculates naval power, Autocannons increase fleet power disproportionately to their general effectiveness in combat. This can be used to artificially increase an empire's military strength rating for political power in the Galactic Community or to persuade other empires to willingly become vassals.

Nanite Autocannons are available to Cosmogenesis Crisis Level V empires, through the Flood of Supremacy tradition, and also accessible as salvage from defeating the Scavenger Bot .

### Kinetic Launcher

Kinetic Launchers are a bigger, slower-firing version of the mass driver that is capable of launching very big and very powerful solid projectiles over extreme distances. Their main advantage is their sheer destructive power coupled with an impressive range, but their design limits them to large slots. They are extremely effective against shields, somewhat effective against hull and very ineffective against armor.

Kinetic launchers almost strictly outperform tech equivalent large mass drivers, as they have both higher range and damage. The only noteworthy weakness is the slightly higher minimum range, and loss of 5% tracking.

- Can fit into Large slots
- **7.15** day cooldown
- **75%** accuracy
- 200% damage against Shield shield
- 50% damage against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kinetic Battery | | 88 1.30 | 70 | 150–450 (300.0) | 45–120 | 0% | 31.46 |
| Kinetic Artillery | | 114 1.69 | 91 | 195–585 (390.0) | 45–120 | 0% | 40.90 |

The biological variant is called the Chitin Battery. It has a longer cooldown, deals less damage, and has a shorter range.

- **10.65** day cooldown

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chitin Battery | | 88 1.30 | 70 | 120-360 (240.0) | 45–96 | 0% | 16.90 |
| Chitin Artillery | | 114 1.69 | 91 | 156-468 (312.0) | 45–96 | 0% | 21.97 |

### Mega Cannon

Essentially scaled-up Kinetic Launchers, Mega Cannons are enormous mass accelerators that can only be placed in a spinal mount and fire huge, monstrously powerful disc-shaped projectiles over extreme distances. They are very effective against shields and severely ineffective against armor.

While they have a smaller shield damage multiplier than kinetic artillery, their higher base damage means that they strictly outperform a slot equivalent number of kinetic artillery in all situations, even against shields.

- Can fit into Extra-Large slots
- **11.4** day cooldown
- **75%** accuracy
- **25°** firing arc
- 150% damage against Shield shield
- 75% damage against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mega Cannon | | 176 2.60 | 200 | 700–2000 (1350.0) | 45–150 | 0% | 88.81 |
| Giga Cannon | | 229 3.38 | 260 | 910–2600 (1755.0) | 45–150 | 0% | 115.46 |

The biological variant shares the same name, but has a longer cooldown, shorter range and deals less damage.

- **17.0** day cooldown

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mega Cannon | | 176 2.60 | 200 | 560-1600 (1080.0) | 45–120 | 0% | 47.64 |
| Giga Cannon | | 229 3.38 | 260 | 728-2080 (1404.0) | 45–120 | 0% | 61.94 |

### Ancient Saturator Artillery

This is an archaeotech weapon. Damage will be increased by 33% with the Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk, and 15% with the Rubricator relic.

The Saturator Artillery has the same firing profile in firing rate, range, accuracy, and tracking as the Giga Cannon with a tradeoff of more shield and hull damage but less armor damage. This makes it better at knocking down the shields or finishing the hull of enemy capital ships, but increases the dependence on other anti-armor weapons against heavily armored foes. This makes it worse against the Prethoryn Scourge end-game crisis, and better against the Extradimensional Invaders crisis.

A note about this weapon is that the unlocking tech can unlock X-slot weapons for battleships before you even research battleships, when most X-slot weapons require Battleships to already be researched before they can be rolled for research, allowing for earlier X-slot damage.

### Mandibles

Mandibles are a weapon class unique to biological shipsets, and exclusive for maulers. They replace Torpedoes, which cannot be researched by empires with a biological shipset. Like torpedoes, mandibles bypass shields and deal size-based damage (though at a lower percentage), but they have a very short range, higher accuracy and tracking, and a much faster cooldown.

## Explosive weapons

Based on Engineering technology, explosive weapons fire guided projectiles that carry an explosive payload.

Explosive weapons can be divided into 3 categories: missiles, swarmer missiles and torpedoes. Missiles have very long range compared to other weapons of similar size and ignore shields. They have 100% accuracy and decent Tracking, but their projectiles can be shot down by point defense weapons, so their actual average damage depends on the enemy's point-defense capabilities. Swarmer missiles have stats comparable to double the amount of missiles, but fire twice as fast and are a lot more resilient against point defense weapons, which also allows them to soak up point defense hits that otherwise would have hit more vulnerable missiles and torpedoes. Torpedoes have very short range, very long reload times, and ignore shields. They deal bonus damage against large targets, potentially so much so that they can instantly kill them in a single attack, but are very vulnerable to point defense because of their slow speed and long cooldown times.

Unlike all other weapons, explosive weapons do not instantly deal damage to their targets when they are fired and instead have to travel to them first.

Missiles fit into Small slots, swarmer missiles fit into Medium slots, and torpedoes and Scourge Missiles can be installed in Torpedo slots.

Most advanced explosive weapons require Volatile Motes to build.

### Missiles

Space-to-space missiles equipped with various warheads. Although based on old pre-space technology, these fire-and-forget weapons can be surprisingly effective at range. Compared to other missiles, they deal low damage over time and have moderate survivability against point defense. Relative to their size, they offer marginally better per-shot damage than swarmer missiles when used in pairs, offering some niche utility in certain cases. Empires using biological shipsets cannot research regular missiles.

- Can fit into Small slots
- **8.5** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy
- **18** speed
- **100** retargeting range
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- 100% penetration against Shield shield

### Ancient Nano-Missile Cloud Launcher

This is an archaeotech weapon. Damage will be increased by 33% with the Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk, and 15% with the Rubricator relic.

While this weapon does direct hull damage, it is most effective as a means to swarm point defense and enable other missiles to get through. A few nano-missiles from a long-range vessel will significantly increase the effectiveness of other dedicated missile ships against enemies with significant point defense, such as Fallen Empires.

- Can fit into Small slots
- **0–100** Range
- **0.85** day cooldown

| Ancient Nano-Missile Cloud Launcher | | 17 10 | 10 | 3–5 (4.0) | 0–100 | 25% | 4.7 | 5 | 5 | 20% | 400 |

### Swarmer missiles

These smaller missiles are launched in large volleys and have been specifically designed to saturate and overwhelm enemy point-defense systems through sheer numbers. In previous versions, swarmer missiles did less damage than normal missiles, but this is no longer the case – swarmer missiles are now almost strictly better than normal missiles, with longer range, higher individual damage, shorter cooldown, better power efficiency, higher tracking, and extremely high survivability against point-defense. The chief advantage of normal missiles over swarmer missiles is their ability to fit into (usually more numerous) Small weapon slots.

- Can fit into Medium slots
- **4.25** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy
- **18** speed
- **100** retargeting range
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- 100% penetration against Shield shield
- **100%** damage against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Evasion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Swarmer Missiles | | 34 | 10 | 36–50 (43.0) | 0–120 | 30% | 10.11 | 20 | 10 | 0% |
| Whirlwind Missiles | | 44 0.65 | 17 | 61–85 (73.0) | 0–120 | 30% | 17.17 | 30 | 15 | 0% |

The biological variant of Swarmer missiles use Torpedo Slots instead (but only on the Harbinger), and feature reduced shield penetration in exchange for bonuses to armor and hull damage. Bio-swarmer missiles can also be fit into medium slots. In every other respect, Bio-Swarmer missiles are identical to their mechanical counterparts.

- Can fit into Medium and Torpedo slots
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- 50% penetration against Shield shield
- 150% damage against Armor armor
- 125% damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Evasion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bio-Swarmer Missiles | | 34 | 10 | 36–50 (43.0) | 0–120 | 30% | 10.11 | 20 | 10 | 0% |
| Bio-Whirlwind Missiles | | 44 0.65 | 17 | 61–85 (73.0) | 0–120 | 30% | 17.17 | 30 | 15 | 0% |

### Torpedoes

Exclusive for Mechanical ships, Torpedoes are essentially very large, slow-moving missiles, equipped with more powerful warheads. Torpedoes have extremely low range, low fire rate and travel slowly, but deal huge amounts of damage, especially to large ships. Compared to other missiles, torpedoes have significantly worse range and point defense survivability, but deal significantly more damage, especially against large ships. Empires using biological shipsets cannot research torpedoes.

- Can fit into Torpedo slots
- **20.75** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy

- Additional multiplicative damage based on 100% of the target's ship size.
 - Total Damage = (Ship Size + 1) * Base Damage

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Evasion | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Space Torpedoes | | 34 | 20 | 100–150 (125.0) | 0–30 | 10% | 6.02 | 4 | 4 | 0% | 200 |

### Scourge Missiles

Salvaged from Prethoryn Scourge and based on Society technology, scourge missiles are a hybrid of missile and torpedo.

- **5.7** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy
- **18** speed
- **120** retargeting range
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- 100% penetration against Shield shield
- 80% damage against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull
- Additional multiplicative damage based on 50% of the target's ship size
 - Total Damage = (1 + 0.5 * Ship Size) * Base Damage

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Range | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Evasion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Large Scourge Missile | | 65 | 35 | 135–175 (155.0) | 0–90 | 80% | 27.19 | 15 | 0 | 40% |

## Strike craft

Strike craft hangars do not attack the enemy directly, but instead launch small spaceships to attack. Like explosive weapons, strike craft ignore shields but can be shot down by P slot weapons, being especially vulnerable to flak. Strike craft can also target other strike craft, though unlike P slot weapons they cannot target missiles. All strike craft go in a special hangar slot. Outside of combat, strike craft regenerate at the rate displayed in game to the hanger capacity, but in combat, they regenerate at 20% of the rate in game continually and can exceed their hangar capacity if not destroyed quickly enough.

The DPS takes into account the number of strike craft per hangar. However, this number is at best a rough estimation of how much damage they can do, as strike craft are often shot down before they can reach their targets. In addition to this, strike craft continually spawn as mentioned above, leading to potentially much higher DPS during long battles against a fleet without point defense.

Fire rate, weapon damage, and strike craft damage modifiers only affect military power of the strike craft themselves.

### Regular Strike Craft

Based on Engineering technology, these manned strike craft are launched from a hangar or carrier mothership and rely on their speed, agility and small size to survive long enough to attack their targets. Strike craft have relatively high DPS for their slot size, can attack a long distance from their mothership, aren't weak to any defense type, and have effectively perfect tracking, making them extremely threatening against small ships that rely on evasion. However, they have poor survivability against flak, the only exception being Skravird Strike Craft thanks to their armor.

- **8** units per hangar
- **0.5** units regenerated/ Time
- **2.3** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy
- **10** attack range
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- 100% penetration against Shield shield
- 150% damage against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Shield Shield | Evasion | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scout Wing | | 40 | 20 | 4–8 (6) | 70% | 20.86 | 5 | 0 | 10 | 60% | 550 |
| Basic Strike Craft | | 68 | 34 | 4–10 (7) | 80% | 24.34 | 7 | 0 | 15 | 65% | 600 |
| Improved Strike Craft | | 68 | 45 | 5–13 (9) | 90% | 31.30 | 10 | 0 | 20 | 80% | 650 |
| Advanced Strike Craft | | 88 | 59 | 6–17 (11.5) | 100% | 40.00 | 12 | 0 | 25 | 80% | 700 |
| Skravird Strike Craft | | 114 | 73 | 8–18 (13) | 100% | 45.21 | 13 | 5 | 25 | 85% | 725 |

The biological variant of strike craft is based on Society technology. They launch twice as many strike craft per hangar, but the craft deal half as much damage on hit, resulting in the same DPS once all craft have launched. Additionally, they use armor instead of shields and their hull strength is reduced, making them less vulnerable to flak than their mechanical counterparts but more vulnerable to point defense.

- **16** units per hangar
- **1** unit regenerated/ Time

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Shield Shield | Evasion | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scout Wing | | 140 | 20 | 2-4 (3) | 70% | 20.86 | 2 | 5 | 0 | 60% | 550 |
| Basic Fighter Wing | | 238 | 34 | 2-5 (3.5) | 80% | 24.34 | 3 | 7 | 0 | 65% | 600 |
| Improved Fighter Wing | | 238 | 45 | 2-6 (4) | 90% | 31.30 | 5 | 10 | 0 | 80% | 650 |
| Advanced Fighter Wing | | 308 | 59 | 3-8 (5.5) | 100% | 40.00 | 6 | 12 | 0 | 80% | 700 |
| Skravird Fighter Wing | | 399 | 73 | 4-9 (6.5) | 100% | 45.21 | 6 | 12 | 2 | 85% | 725 |

### Amoeba

Based on Society technology, an empire can breed Space Amoebae and use its flagella as strike craft. They are the only strike craft not to have 100% accuracy, instead having 70%. They are very effective against armor. Compared to regular strike craft, they're broadly stronger than T2, but have less tracking, and since they have low evasion and no shields, they are vulnerable to point defense in addition to flak.

- **8** units per hangar
- **0.5** units regenerated/ Time
- **5.0** day cooldown
- **70%** accuracy
- **10** attack range
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- 100% penetration against Shield shield
- 150% damage against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Shield Shield | Evasion | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Amoeba Flagella | | 60 | 30 | 20–30 (25.0) | 50% | 40.00 | 20 | 0 | 0 | 50% | 500 |

### Swarm Strikers

Based on Society technology, these cloned and miniaturized Prethoryn specimen can be controlled and used as strike craft. They ignore 66% of the target's armor points, allowing them to deal damage directly to the hull, albeit with a 33% damage reduction.

As swarm strikers have armor instead of shields, they are exceptionally effective at fighting conventional strike craft, and are not vulnerable to flak. Point defense works well, but has less inherent tracking, and struggles to hit the high evasion swarm strikers without additional modifiers.

- **10** units per hangar
- **0.5** units regenerated/ Time
- **2.0** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy
- **10** attack range
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- 100% penetration against Shield shield
- **100%** damage against Armor armor
- 66% penetration against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Shield Shield | Evasion | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Swarm Strikers | | 100 | 80 | 8–12 (10.0) | 80% | 50.00 | 40 | 20 | 0 | 80% | 400 |

### Ancient Driller Drones

This is an archaeotech weapon. Damage will be increased by 33% with the Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk, and 15% with the Rubricator relic.

Unlike most fighters, Ancient Driller Drones do not penetrate Shields, but do penetrate armor. This makes them particularly effective in Pulsar systems where shields are stripped, against certain Leviathans that lack shields, against recently-cloaked fleets, and against the Prethroryn Scourge crisis. However, it makes them far less effective against ordinary strike craft in other situations.

- **8** units per hangar
- **0.5** units regenerated/ Time
- **2.30** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy
- **10** attack range
- 50% damage against Shield shield
- **100%** damage against Armor armor
- 100% penetration against Armor armor
- 125% damage against hull

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Shield Shield | Evasion | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ancient Driller Drones | | 88 10 | 59 | 4–16 (10.0) | 100% | 34.78 | 10 | 0 | 25 | 80% | 700 |

Biological Ancient Driller Drones launch more units than the mechanical variant, but each unit does less damage and has its shields replaced with armor.

- **16** units per hangar
- **1** unit regenerated/ Time

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Shield Shield | Evasion | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ancient Driller Drones | | 308 10 | 59 | 2-8 (5.0) | 100% | 34.78 | 5 | 12 | 0 | 80% | 700 |

### Psionic Bombers

This is a shroud weapon. Unlike other strike crafts and similar to torpedos, Psionic Bombers deal increased damage to larger ships, but have trouble with hitting smaller targets, like corvettes or other strike crafts due to low tracking. These strike crafts are exclusive to mechanical ships. For biological ships, see their counterpart below.

- **8** units per hangar
- **0.5** units regenerated/ Time
- **2.30** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy
- **10** attack range
- **100%** damage against Shield shield
- 100% penetration against Shield shield
- 150% damage against Armor armor
- **100%** damage against hull
- Additional multiplicative damage based on 50% of the target's ship size.
 - Total Damage = (Ship Size * 0.5 + 1) * Base Damage

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Shield Shield | Evasion | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Psionic Bombers | | 114 1 | 73 | 5–13 (9) | 35% | 31.30 | 13 | 0 | 35 | 90% | 800 |

As with regular strike craft, biological shipsets have their own variant of the Psionic Bomber, called the Psionic Sapper. It follows the same pattern as the other biological strike craft - more units per hangar, less damage, and with shields replaced with armor.

- **16** units per hangar
- **1** unit regenerated/ Time

| Weapon | Size | Cost | Power Power | Damage per hit (average) | Tracking Tracking | / Time Average damage | Hull | Armor Armor | Shield Shield | Evasion | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Psionic Sappers | | 399 1 | 73 | 2.5–6.5 (4.5) | 35% | 31.30 | 6 | 17 | 0 | 90% | 800 |

## Weaver Weapons

Based on Society technology, Weavers use a set of special weapons that all use the Point-Defense slot. They either fall in the supressor or support role, depending on if they are aimed at allies or enemies. All weapons go to tier 6, which can only be obtained from the Shattered Fragment or by taking the Cosmogenesis Crisis Perk.

### Support

Support weapons provide beneficial effects to friendly ships.

#### Spore Launchers

Spore launchers are designed to repair your own ships and offer at later levels regeneration buffs.

## Point-defense weapons

Point-defense weapons are small turrets that are capable of targeting and destroying incoming missiles and strike craft, preventing them from dealing damage to the ship. They can be hard to use against full-size warships, however, as they have very low range compared to other weapons. They come in two types: flak guns and point-defense, both of which are capable of attacking enemy ships, missiles and strike craft.

Flak guns have high tracking and are extremely effective against shields and ineffective against armor, making them extremely effective at destroying strike craft, which rely on evasion and shields to survive. They are also effective against the shields of regular ships at short range, especially in the earlygame when autocannons are not yet available. Point-defense weapons are the opposite – they have low tracking, deal high damage to armor, and little damage to shields. This makes them best for destroying missiles and especially torpedoes, which use armor instead of shields and have low evasion. They can, however, still be overwhelmed by swarmer missiles and especially ancient nano-missile cloud launchers, making them far less effective when these weapons are being fielded by the enemy side.

All point-defense weapons use Point-Defense slot.

Weavers cannot install these weapons.

### Flak guns

Based on Engineering technologies, these gun batteries fire small-size explosive fragmentation rounds that create shrapnel at close range detonation, allowing them to easily destroy enemy strike craft.

Nanite Flak Batteries are only accessible to Cosmogenesis Crisis Level V empires, through the Flood of Supremacy tradition, and also as salvage from defeating the Scavenger Bot . Unlike Nanite Autocannons they do not need nanites to build.

### Ancient Defensive Web Slinger

This is an archaeotech weapon based on Society technology. Damage will be increased by 33% with the Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk, and 15% with the Rubricator relic.

When compared to the Guardian Point-Defense, the Defensive Web Slinger has equal accuracy and tracking, but trades 50% slower firing rate for 25% higher damage-per-hit, resulting in comparably lower average damage over time. This can be overcome with the Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk, however. The Defensive Web Slinger also has much higher Minor Artifacts costs for its slot size compared to other archaeotech weapons.

The biological variant is identical to the mechanical one, but is named the Ancient Web Slinger.

- **0.75** day cooldown
- **75%** accuracy
- 25% damage against Shield shield
- 200% damage against Armor armor
- 25% penetration against Armor armor

### Ancient Ruination Glare

This is an archaeotech weapon. Damage will be increased by 33% with the Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk, and 15% with the Rubricator relic.

Its faster fire rate, greater armor damage, and potential Archaeo-Engineer bonus make it stronger than the Perdition beam. Its shorter range will move the vessel into artillery range, increasing the risk of being targeted by enemy artillery.

- **14.5** day cooldown
- **85%** accuracy
- 50% damage against Shield shield
- 175% damage against Armor armor
- 125% damage against hull

## World Devastator weapons

See Colossus and Star-Eater .

Although technically mounted on a weapon slot and used by a spaceship, these weapons are not used in ship-to-ship combat. Instead, they affect celestial bodies.

## Unobtainable Weapons

There are an assortment of armaments that regular empires cannot acquire through research or reverse engineering. They mostly come from space fauna or are special crisis components.

### Voidworm Weapons

#### Spikespores

These missile-like weapons are used by Voidworms. Like the missiles regular empires can acquire, they fully penetrate shields but have no notable advantage over the armor or hull layers of their targets. They can be shot down with point defense.

| Spikespores | | 72.0–100.0 (86.0) | 0–90 | 30% | 20.24 | 20 | 10.0 | 0% | 400 |

#### Voidworm Fangs

The voidworms use their fangs to bite down on any ship that gets too close to them. While not penetrating shields or armor, it deals twice the damage to both, making the most effective types of defense to either stack a lot of armor health on ship designs for their higher health compared to shields at the same tech level, or simply keeping distance from the worms. With perfect accuracy and high tracking, corvettes and frigates are extremely vulnerable in the early game due to their ship computers compelling them to close in on hostile ships. However, voidworms can only bite down on ships that are in front of them: the weapon has a firing arc of 15 degrees.

- **27.7** day cooldown
- **100%** accuracy

### Gray Tempest and Dessanu Consonance

#### Nanite Fighters

The Gray Tempest utilises the gate builders strike craft, which attack slowly, but are exceptionally hard to intercept. Unlike player strike craft, Nanite Figthers are unable to act as point defense and will only target enemy ships. They are among the slowest, but by far the most durable strike craft in the game. A ship equipped with these strike craft can be obtained from the 42 Years and 3 Days situation.

### Contingency

#### Seeker Drones

This is the Contingency's version of strike craft, being only employed at their AI cores in hub systems. Unlike any other type of strike craft in the game, they have thick layers of both armor and shields, giving regular point defense truly a run for their money. Seeker Drones are unable to target other strike crafts and will only attack ships. Their enemy fleets can only really hope to outlive the swarms of seeker drones.
