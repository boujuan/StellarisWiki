# Achievements

**Stellaris** has 211 different Steam **achievements** . Achievements have no in-game effects, the achievement just pops up in-game and then is added to the player's Steam profile. It is possible to see the achievements sorted by the percentage of users that managed to complete each achievement by going to the game's global stats at Steam .

The difficulty of each achievement varies; some achievements are very easy (e.g. colonizing a planet), while some are extremely difficult (e.g. end-game crisis achievements). The below list groups the various achievements by a difficulty level as assessed by the wiki editors (uncategorized - UC - achievements haven't been assessed yet).

Achievements cannot be earned if any console command has been used or if any installed mod has altered the game's checksum. They can be earned even after any empire has attained victory . Difficulty plays no role in achievements, meaning most can be more easily obtained by playing on lower settings like Civilian and Cadet. Achievements can be earned in both singleplayer and multiplayer.

## Useful tricks

### Zero empires

The easiest way to earn most achievements is to start a game without AI empires and maximum number of habitable worlds. This way achievements can be completed at your leisure and there is no drawback to minimizing research and tradition costs. If an achievement requires the existence of another empire just create one planet sectors and then turn them into vassals.

#### Galactic Community voting

If you wait until you become sufficiently powerful and then release two or more vassals, you will receive the offer to form the Galactic Community a few months later. This will guarantee you are strong enough to decide the outcome of Galactic Community resolutions by yourself, especially if you set the subject terms to Restricted Voting.

### Empire switching

A few achievements are particularly difficult because it requires an empire to act in a certain way beforehand. There are multiple ways you can switch from one empire to another:g

- If you host a singleplayer game as a multiplayer session, you can freely select a different empire. Pick whichever empire you want, and take whatever actions you need that empire to take. Any games saved in multiplayer session will cause the singleplayer save to open on the last played empire. Once you're done, you can use a second multiplayer session to switch back to your own empire.
- If the Synthetic Dawn DLC is installed, you can use an AI rebellion to switch to a machine empire. Have as many Mechanical pops as possible to start with most systems from your previous empire and once the AI-Related Incidents situation is almost complete disband all fleets.
- Completing the cosmogenesis victory also allows the empire to be switched.

## List of achievements

The "Ver" column indicates in which version a certain achievement was added. Achievements cannot be earned prior to the version they were added in.

The "DI" column is for difficulty as assessed by wiki editors. VE = Very Easy, E = Easy, M = Medium, H = Hard, VH = Very Hard, I = Insane, UC = Uncategorized.

| **Rift Sealed** Destroy the portals employed by the invaders from another time and space. | Defeat the Extradimensional Invaders by destroying the final Dimensional Portal | Like all crises, lowering the Crisis Strength setting to 0.25x makes this a lot easier to achieve. | 1.0 | VH |

| **What Was Will Be** Close the loop, or don't. | Complete the Horizon Signal event chain and either outcome | The difficulty lies in having the Horizon Signal event spawn - there is a 20% chance at the start of each game that a random black hole in the galaxy will contain the beginning of the event chain. Following the events is fairly straightforward - in the end, accepting the Worm's offer is the easier option. | 1.4 | VH |

### Plantoids

It makes no difference whether the Ketlings spawn or form their own empire or not. Colonize or invade, and then terraform all six Tomb worlds into Gaia worlds. Terraforming method does not matter, but the most effective and certain way is to do it with the Gaia Seeder buildings available to Idyllic Bloom empires. Both require the Climate Restoration technology to be unlocked or to terraform Tomb Worlds. The zero empires trick will make this achievement much easier, ensuring that the required systems are not claimed by another empire. If the Galactic Paragons DLC is enabled, the Conquer Nature agenda from the Adaptability tradition tree makes this achievement easier by unlocking the next terraforming tech as a permanent research option when launched. | 3.5 | H |

If you are currently the president of a federation, the federation will be converted into the League of Non-Aligned Empires.

You can force-spawn an empire with Teachers of the Shroud origin, buy communications with other empires then with this empire to have contact with Shroud-Touched Coven enclave as soon as possible. Note that the enclave disappears once the endgame crisis appears, setting the endgame crisis to none may be useful to guarantee the existence of the enclave. Robotic or Cyborg, Cybernetic leaders cannot get the Brain Slug Host leader trait. | 3.5 | H |
| **Directive 67** As a Clone Army empire, denounce the Spiritualist fallen empire then destroy them. | Denounce the Holy Guardians/Doctrinal Enforcers in the Galactic Community and destroy them while playing an empire with the Clone Army origin | Despite the achievement's description, the Holy Guardians/Doctrinal Enforcers must be declared a crisis , not denounced. Become sufficiently powerful to decide the outcome of Galactic Community resolutions and to fight the fallen empire. Note that declaring a crisis requires the Nemesis DLC. Force-spawning a Spiritualist Scion will guarantee that the Holy Guardians spawn in the galaxy. Setting the endgame date to as high as possible will help make it so the Holy Guardians do not awaken and become more powerful. The galactic community trick will make this achievement much easier. | 3.5 | VH |

### Apocalypse

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Exterminatus** Use a World Cracker to destroy another Empire's capital planet. | Destroy another Empire's capital planet with a World Cracker Colossus | Unlock and construct a World Cracker, create a vassal, release it and once the truce is over, declare war and destroy their capital. Core Cracker is not available to Pacifist empires. | 2.0 | M |
| **Clash of the Titans** Defeat a Fallen Empire's Titan fleet with a Titan of your own. | Defeat a Fallen Empire Titan fleet with your own Titan. | When starting the game set the end-game year as late as possible to avoid Fallen Empires awakening, set the tech costs to minimum to keep researching combat-related repeatable technologies and set the number of Fallen Empires to maximum, because not all of them will spawn with a titan. Increase Naval Capacity as much as possible to field a fleet of titans, then attack the Fallen Empire. Paradox Titan ships will not trigger the achievement, only regular titans will. | 2.0 | H |
| **No Khan Do** Kill the Great Khan in battle. | Destroy the Great Khan and their fleet in battle | The Great Khan is killed in battle when their fleet is destroyed or defeated in a battle a second time. If the AI kills the Great Khan's first fleet, it may be prudent to make a beeline to the Khanate's territory to make sure you can find the Chosen of the Great Khan before the AI can find them first. | 2.0 | H |
| **Pandora's World** Use a Global Pacifier to shield a planet belonging to Fanatic Purifiers, Ravenous Swarms, or Determined Exterminators. | Use a Global Pacifier Colossus to shield a world belonging to a Fanatic Purifiers, Devouring Swarm or Determined Exterminator empire | Other genocidal civics will not work. Fanatic Purifiers are friendly towards other Fanatic Purifiers with the same species and Determined Exterminators are friendly towards empires with a Machine founder species as long as they're not Rogue Servitor. This allows conflict to be avoided until you have a colossus. | 2.0 | H |
| **Stay on Target** Destroy another Empire's Colossus while it is in the process of firing on a planet. | Destroy an enemy Colossus while it is firing on a planet | Despite what the achievement says, the Collosus needs only to be in orbit of a planet and destroyed. Fallen Empires can spawn with one Colossus, and may build one after awakening (the Spiritualist FE will immediately awaken if you crack a holy world). The AI will have its Colossus try to run away when you enter the system with your fleet(s). It is therefore advisable that you extend your weapons range as much as possible, and/or enter as close as possible to the Colossus so that you may engage it before it leaves orbit (as you will not get the achievement if the firing process is interrupted by leaving orbit before your attack). | 2.0 | I |

### Distant Stars

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **...and Hope?** Unseal the path to the L-Cluster. | Be the first to open an L-Gate | Using the zero empires trick makes getting this achievement a matter of time. | 2.1 | E |
| **It Followed Me Home** Befriend a Space Amoeba. | Make friends with a Space Amoeba | See Lost Amoeba for event chain details. | 2.1 | M |

### MegaCorp

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Black Hole Mining** Build a Matter Decompressor. | Construct a complete Matter Decompressor | Repairing a destroyed Matter Decompressor does not count. When choosing ascension perks, remember that this megastructure requires the Galactic Wonders ascension perk. | 2.2 | M |
| **Franchising** As a Corporate empire, have a branch office on 5 different empires' capitals. | Have the Corporate government type and have branch offices on other empires' capitals > 4 | This achievement will not unlock if playing as a Criminal Heritage. Easiest way to obtain it is with the Imperial Fiefdom origin on a Large or Huge galaxy. | 2.2 | M |
| **Inscrutable Power** I won the Galatron and all I got was this lousy achievement. | Obtain The Galatron | The Galatron is a very rare reward from the Caravaneers reliquaries. The reward is decided when the reliquary is bought so it can be obtained easily (though tediously) by saving and reloading. | 2.2 | M |
| **Obscure Tastes** Build a Mega-Art Installation in a nebula system. | Construct a complete Mega Art Installation (including the Perfection stage) in a system within a nebula | Repairing a destroyed Mega-Art Installation does not count. Remember that Perfection stage requires Ancient Relics enabled and 2000 minor artifacts. The Ocean Paradise origin allows you to start the game inside of a nebula. | 2.2 | M |
| **Strategic Initiative** Build a Strategic Coordination Center. | Construct a complete Strategic Coordination Center | Repairing a destroyed Strategic Coordination Center does not count. | 2.2 | M |
| **United Space** Build an Interstellar Assembly. | Construct a complete Interstellar Assembly | Repairing a destroyed Interstellar Assembly does not count. | 2.2 | M |
| **Raiders of the Lost Galatron** Capture the Galatron from another empire. | Capture The Galatron from an empire with it in war | Activating the Galatron once after getting it gives all empires a casus belli for taking it from its current owner. Either wait and hope an empire gets it from the reliquaries and then declare war on them, or get the Galatron yourself, lose it in a war and reconquer it after the truce. AI empires tend to choose the correct belli when fighting a non-total war against you, so it should work to declare a subjugation war against a significantly weaker empire, surrender immediately, and crush them as soon as ten years pass. You can also use the empire switch trick to make this achievement easier. | 2.3 | VH |

### Ancient Relics

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Arcana** Study Minor Artifacts and discover a random technology. | Use the Reverse-Engineer Arcane Technology relic option | Requires the Arcane Deciphering technology which unlocks Reverse-Engineer Arcane Technology option, which will give 1 of 4 possible outcomes at random. Getting either a random technology or a bonus to tech speed will give the achievement. | 2.3 | E |
| **Artificer** Have 100 Minor Artifacts. | Has > 999 Minor Artifacts | Despite the description, this achievement actually requires 1000 minor artifacts, not 100. Getting the Rubricator relic may help in cases where no other way to obtain minor artifacts is available. This achievement becomes far easier if the Federations DLC is enabled. The On the Shoulders of Giants origin will provide a large number of minor artifacts, occasionally enough for the achievement. | 2.3 | E |
| **Dust Off** Complete the Zroni Precursor chain. | Finish the Zroni Precursor chain | Enable only the Zroni when starting a new game to avoid triggering another precursor chain. | 2.3 | M |
| **Green Thumb** Complete the Baol Precursor chain. | Finish the Baol Precursor chain | Enable only the Baol when starting a new game to avoid triggering another precursor chain. | 2.3 | M |
| **Relic Hunter** In one game, find 5 Relics from Ancient Relics Story Pack. | Own at least 5 relics | Despite what it says, any 5 relics will work. The Treasure Hunters origin starts with a relic. The Surveyor is also easy to get. If Huge galaxy size was chosen, Crystal of Odryskia is also guaranteed, but it can make other relics harder to find. You can use the zero empires trick and set pre-FTL civilizations to x0 to make sure that nobody gains relics before you. | 2.3 | M |
| **We'll Make Great Pets** Have at least 1000 pops of your primary species on display in Alien Zoos within your empire. | Has > 999 pops that:<br>- Same species as founder<br>- Not sapient<br>- is either in the pre sapient or slave strata | Make sure your<br>Pre-Sapients policy is set to Protected.<br>Depending on installed DLC, pre-sapient pops of your own species can be acquired the following ways:<br>- With BioGenesis DLC, pre-sapient pops created by the Nascent Stage trait can easily trigger the achievement.<br>- With Apocalypse DLC, release a planet as a vassal, then grant it independence. Select the Colossus Project ascension perk and research the Devolving Beam technology. Once the truce expires, declare war and use a Colossus equipped with the Devolving Beam on any of their planets with a sufficient pop count.<br>- With Utopia or Shadows of the Shroud DLC, pursue Psionic ascension and form a covenant with the Composer of Strands. Every 15 years there is a 25% chance that 400 Psionic pops become pre-sapient. The third time this occurs you will have enough pre-sapient pops for the achievement. To guarantee that the Psionic pops are of your species, make sure you have no other Psionic species in the empire.<br>Once you have enough pre-sapient pops for the achievement, build an Alien Zoo. The pre-sapient version of your species will now all occupy Conserved Fauna jobs.<br>Note: Livestock slavery of your primary species through a<br>Slaver Guilds<br>civic will not work; species with Full Citizenship will not correctly switch to Livestock category jobs, even when set to Livestock slavery type. | 3.7 | H |

### Lithoids

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Can You Smell What the Lithoids are Cooking?** As a Lithoid empire, keep another Lithoid pop as Livestock or Process them. | As a Lithoid empire, keep another Lithoid pop as Livestock or Process them. | Can be obtained from the start, if the Utopia DLC is enabled, via the Syncretic Evolution origin. | 3.5 | E |
| **Rock Beats Paper** As a Lithoid empire, show the Galactic Community exactly what you think of that strongly worded letter. | As a Lithoid empire, execute or eat the envoys of the Galactic Community. | The strongly worded letter event will happen at the start of the next decade if in breach of the galactic law. Once the event fires, pick the option to execute/eat the envoys. The option requires being Xenophobe, Imperial, Hive Mind or Necrophage and a member of the Galactic Community. It is not available if the empire is Pacifist, Xenophile or Empath. | 3.5 | M |
| **Room for Desert** Consume another empire’s desert homeworld. | Consume another empire's desert homeworld. | Create a Lithoid empire with the Terravore civic. Custom enemy empires with nothing but bad traits, no civics and a desert homeworld can be created to facilitate the process. Take their homeworld, start the Consume World situation and wait for it to progress completely. | 3.5 | M |

### Federations

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Let Us Go Forward Together** Level up your Federation. | Level up a Federation you are in | The Common Ground and Hegemon origins make this achievement much easier. | 2.6 | VE |
| **Throw Your Weight Around** Have a Diplomatic Weight of over 9000. | Have your Diplomatic Weight > 8999 | This achievement is easily achieved by the endgame of a typical playthrough. | 2.6 | E |
| **We're Number One** Be the leader of a max level Federation. | Be the leader of a Level 5 Federation | The Common Ground and Hegemon origins make this achievement much easier. | 2.6 | E |
| **Whatever it is, I'm against it** Refuse to belong to any club that would have you as a member. | Reject the creation of the Galactic Community and leave a Federation | Start the game with the Common Ground or Hegemon origin. When offered to form the Galactic Community, refuse your support. You need to be one of the empires offered to form the Galactic Community. Refusing to join an already-formed Galactic Community will not count towards this achievement. If the community fails to be created, it wont count towards this achievement either. You can use the zero empires trick and release a sector as vassal to guarantee this achievement. | 2.6 | E |
| **Our Fleets will Blot Out the Stars** Construct a complete Mega-Shipyard. | Construct a complete Mega-Shipyard | Repairing a destroyed Mega-Shipyard does not count. Can be obtained without the DLC if a completed Mega-Shipyard is acquired from an Awakened Empire. | 2.6 | M |
| **Unstoppable Force** Build a Juggernaut. | Build a Juggernaut ship type | This achievement will be earned naturally while playing the game. | 2.6 | M |
| **You've Been Served** Denounce an Empire that is not actually in breach of galactic law while all major sanctions have been passed. | Pass any Denounce resolution on an Empire that isn't in breach of Galactic Law while all major sanctions are active | Become sufficiently powerful to decide the outcome of Galactic Community resolutions, and play for a sufficient amount of time to pass all the necessary sanction resolutions. The galactic community trick will make this achievement much easier, and allow you to form the Galactic Community much sooner. | 2.6 | M |
| **Humble Pie** Humiliate an Empire that is in the Supremacy Diplomatic Stance, forcing them out of it. | Defeat an empire that uses the Supremacist diplomatic stance with the Animosity or Imperial Rebuke casus belli | To use the casus belli on another empire, they must be your rival or the one declaring war. The other empire must be in Supremacist diplomatic stance at the time when they surrender. If Apocalypse DLC is enabled, using a Colossus on a Holy World may cause the Spiritualist fallen empire to immediately awaken with the Supremacist diplomatic stance and immediately declare war on you, allowing you to select the Humiliate casus belli . They will instantly receive additional fleets when they awaken, so make sure they are at least inferior to you military-wise. Using the empire switch trick , you can also set a regular empire to the Supremacist stance and make them declare war on your empire. | 2.6 | H |

### Necroids

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **With Great Power** As a Necrophage, do not invade any pre-ftl civilisations until you defeat the crisis OR have at least 10 observation stations around pre-ftl worlds. | While playing an empire with the Necrophage origin, do not invade any Pre-FTL civilisations until you defeat the crisis, OR have at least 10 Observation Stations around Pre-FTL worlds. | Start the game with the Pre-FTL Civilizations and Pre-Sapient Species set to max. Construct 10 Observation Stations. Guaranteed habitable worlds will spawn as pre-FTLs with this origin instead, so setting them to the maximum of 2 will leave only 8 more to be found naturally. | 3.5 | E |
| **There's a Zombie on my Lawn** As a Necroid empire, eradicate a Plantoid empire, or vice-versa, without blowing up their final planet. | Wipe out a Plantoid empire while playing as a Necroid species, or vice-versa, without using a World Cracker Colossus on their final planet. | A custom Plantoid or Necroid empire with nothing but bad traits and no civics can be force-spawned to facilitate the process. | 3.5 | M |
| **Recent History** As a Memorialist empire, have Galactic Memorials on five tomb worlds that did not start the game as tomb worlds. | As a Civics, Memorialist empire, have a Galactic Memorial on five Tomb Worlds that were not Tomb Worlds at game start. | If no other DLCs are installed this requires the<br>Horizon Signal<br>event chain and accepting the Worm's offer. Otherwise Tomb Worlds can be created through four methods, from easiest to hardest:<br>1. With Toxoids, start the game with the Relentless Industrialists civic, turn 5 planets into Tomb Worlds, then reform to replace the civic with Memorialists.<br>2. With Nemesis, select the Galactic Nemesis ascension perk. At level 3 crisis, it will unlock Armageddon bombardment, which will turn planets into Tomb Worlds after killing the last pop.<br>3. With Utopia or Synthetic Dawn, force-spawn an empire with the Fanatic Purifiers or Determined Exterminator civic. Use the empire switch trick to take control of the genocidal empire, turn 5 planets into Tomb Worlds with Armageddon bombardment, then switch back to your own empire and conquer these worlds.<br>4. With Ancient Relics, possession of the Javorian Pox Sample relic allows the use of the Javorian Pox orbital bombardment regardless of civics, creating Tomb Worlds after killing the last pop. | 3.5 | H |

### Nemesis

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Shoot To Kill** Start a full-fledged first contact war before communications have been fully established. | Destroy 10 ships or conquer a planet of an empire you have not established contact with. | An easy way to get this achievement is to engage spaceborne aliens that are already hostile. The achievement will only unlock once the communications are established. | 3.0 | VE |
| **Burn Notice** Disavow all knowledge of an Asset during an Operation. | When an operation fails, disavow an Asset instead of trying to re-establish contact. | A failed espionage operation may lead to the Asset being exposed, with the option to disavow them. Pick the option. | 3.0 | E |
| **With Thunderous Applause** Become the Galactic Emperor. | Pass the Proclaim Galactic imperium resolution with you as Galactic Custodian | The galactic community trick will make this achievement much easier. | 3.0 | M |
| **Big Red Button** Destroy the Galaxy. | Win the game as a Galactic Nemesis by fully upgrading the Aetherophasic Engine | Lower difficulty settings or the zero empire trick will make this achievement much easier. If Apocalypse is enabled, Menace can instead be gained by destroying worlds with a World Cracker. After obtaining the Aetherophasic Engine, upgrade it until you win the game to unlock the achievement. | 3.0 | H |
| **Modern Cincinnatus** As Galactic Custodian, defeat the end-game Crisis and then end the title rather than finishing your term. | As the Galactic Custodian, approve the End Custodianship resolution after the endgame crisis has been defeated | This can be done more easily using a mid-game Crisis to become the Custodian. Then approve the Galaxy Defense Force and build a fleet to be prepared for the end-game Crisis. The term limit is 30 years, but you can increase it with the resolution: Extend Custodianship. After defeating the Crisis, approve the resolution: End Custodianship. | 3.0 | H |
| **Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Blorg** Complete at least ten distinct operations during a game. | Successfully complete 10 different Espionage Operations during one playthrough | Only 9 Espionage Operations are available at the start of the game: Gather Information, Spark Diplomatic Incident, Prepare Sleeper Cells, Aquire Asset, Extort Favors, Smear Campaign, Steal Technology, Sabotage Starbase, and Arm Privateers. Despite several other Operations existing, Only 2 other Operations count towards this achievement, those being Crisis Beacon, which is available while any Crisis is occurring, and Imperium: Weaken Imperial Authority, which is available when the Galactic Imperium has been proclaimed. No Pre-FTL operations count towards this achievement. Taking the Subterfuge Tradition makes this much easier, due to the increased Codebreaking and Infiltration Growth Speed. Assets are very useful for the harder Operations | 3.0 | H |
| **Sic Semper Tyrannis** Lead a rebellion that successfully deposes the Galactic Emperor. | With the Galactic Imperium proclaimed, be the instigator of a successful rebellion. You will need to Enforce Demands, not Status Quo, to unlock this achievement. | The hardest part is fulfilling the conditions to nominate an AI empire as the<br>Galactic Custodian<br>and later on to proclaim the<br>Galactic Imperium<br>. There are some ways to improve the chances or force an AI empire into this role. Once the AI is Galactic Emperor, you have to bring them down by<br>undermining their authority<br>and sparking a rebellion. You can choose one of these paths:<br>**The waiting game** Increase the council size to 5 (the maximum) and enable veto power. Wait for a crisis to trigger and contain it but don't let it be destroyed. Either veto or quickly pass any resolutions by other council members to free their proposal slots. Ideally, an authoritarian empire nominates itself, as they are more likely to proclaim the Galactic Imperium later. Remember, that egalitarian empire will never choose to proclaim Galactic Imperium. Once a suitable AI empire nominates itself, start building a spy network on them, finishing Subterfuge tradition may be very helpful at this point. Support their nomination and any term extensions, but veto the creation of the Galactic Defense Force. Once the Imperium has been proclaimed, assign envoys to undermine imperial influence. When it is low enough, use your spy to start the rebellion. You can also use an operation to lower imperial authority if envoys are not enough. Be ready to fight the Emperor and any loyalists (which can be everyone except you and your vassals). Avoid making claims (and give up existing claims), as the "demanding unoccupied system/planet" surrender acceptance malus applies, despite the fact that you cannot conquer systems with this war goal and casus belli.<br>**The multiplayer trick**<br>You can host your singleplayer game in a multiplayer session. When you host/join a multiplayer game, you are given the full list of empires to control. You can pick one that you want to designate as the Imperial Core and push them towards this goal. Preparations: You should be a member of the Galactic Council and have enough Diplomatic Weight to influence the resolution results against possible resistance. The target empire must be a member of the Galactic Council. Before making the first move, the Senate should be in recess, your option to Declare Emergency Measure should not be on cooldown, and the target empire must have 300 Influence available. This is visible during the multiplayer hosting process. Once the requirements are met, host a multiplayer game from your singleplayer save game and choose the target empire. As that empire, put forward the resolution to become the Galactic Custodian . Return to the main menu, switch back to your original empire in the same way (also in multiplayer) and declare the new resolution an Emergency Measure . You should not have to unpause the game during this process. At this point, the resolution is on the Senate floor and you can return to your singleplayer session. Later, after the Custodian was elected, you may have to repeat the process to Remove Custodianship Term Limit . A resolution that is only available to the Custodian. Finally, repeat the process to Proclaim the Galactic Imperium . After this, you are set to be a part of the Galactic Imperium with the target empire as the Imperial Core .<br>If you have the Synthetic Dawn you can use the AI rebellion trick. Become galactic emperor, make the AI rebellion situation start, fight until white peace and after a while you will be given the option to join the Galactic Imperium. Accept and then undermine Imperial Authority via the espionage system. Once intel is high enough begin the rebellion operation. | 3.0 | VH |

| **Fishing for Trouble** As an angler empire, provoke a Fallen Empire into declaring war on you and win. | Win a defensive war against a Fallen Empire while playing an empire with an Anglers civic | Start the game with at least two Fallen Empires in case one spawns as Ancient Caretakers. Set the end-game date as late as possible. Become stronger until the Fallen Empire has Inferior relative power and insult it to trigger a war. Do not wait until they have Pathetic relative power, they will not declare war. You must win the war, status quo will not count towards the achievemen.. The empire must not be awakened before declaring war; provoking the Holy Guardians by using a colossus on their holy worlds will make them an invalid target for this achievement. | 3.5 | H |
| **There Be Dragons** Own 13 dragons and have them in your capital system. | Have 13 owned space dragons of any kind in the empire's capital system | Complete the Here Be Dragons origin, preserve the Sky Dragon and grow 10 Fledgling Dragons. Then release a vassal and lend them some Fledgling Dragons to build more. Wait to get the original Fledgling Dragons back and unlock the achievement. Any dragons count, including L-Drakes, the Ether Drake and Shard if they have been obtained via the Reanimators civic or the Mechromancy ascension perk. You can accumulate an extra 2 dragons (Hrozgar, 10 Fledglings, and 2 additional ones) in any combination as long as you own them. | 3.5 | H |

Then catapult crewed science ships into unsurveyed regions. Avoid catapulting near explored systems as the Quantum Catapults may send them there instead. The easiest option is to build ten science ships and re-assign a single scientist before each launch. Alternatively, you may also send a single ship and keep returning to the catapult. | 3.4 | E |
| **None Shall Pass** Have a Fortress World with a Planetary Defense Shield, protected by a fully upgraded orbital ring, filled with defensive modules, with a fleet power of at least 10,000. | Have a Fortress World with >9,999 fleet power and all required buildings and upgrades | Needs a fully upgraded capital building on planet and set the planet designation to Fortress World, have an orbital ring tier 3 around the planet filled with 4 planetary defense modules (guns, missiles, hangars).

Start with the Naval Contractors and Private Military Companies civics to have the capacity to create three Mercenary Enclaves from the start. | 3.4 | M |
| **Non-Prophet Organization** As a Teachers of the Shroud empire, prove that the Shroudwalkers made a terrible mistake. | While playing with the Teachers of the Shroud origin, destroy the Shroudwalker enclave you start the game in contact with | Easily done with ~15k fleet power. Note that the Shroudwalkers will leave the galaxy once the endgame crisis appears. | 3.4 | M |
| **Yeet the Fleet** Catapult a military fleet directly into the capital system of an enemy empire you are at war with. | Use a Quantum Catapult to launch a military fleet into a hostile empire's capital system | Start with the Slingshot to the Stars origin and at least one Fallen Empire. While repairing the megastructure construct many corvettes. Declare war on the Fallen Empire and slingshot all corvettes into its capital system to ensure at least one of them arrives correctly. | 3.4 | M |
| **Meet the New Boss** Same as the old boss. | Pledge secret fealty to another empire and have them win an Allegiance War. | This can be done using the multiplayer trick to get empires to declare the correct war. If the Shadows of the Shroud DLC is installed you can ensure, via a proxy war ( Subterfuge), that the empire declares a war using the correct war goal. | 3.4 | H |
| **Underlord** As a Subterranean empire, dig too deep, but prove yourself worthy. | Clear the Unexpected Mineral Seams event as an empire with the Subterranean origin | See Unexpected Mineral Seams for event chain details.

This includes pre-FTL civilizations, crises, marauders and all L-Cluster outcomes, but not space creatures. Use the zero empires trick. Choose to become Fanatic Purifiers at the end of the origin and destroy all enclaves. If you turn off every DLC creating enclaves (Leviathans, Distant Stars, Overlord, Grand Archive, Shadows of the Shroud), you will get the achievement instantly. | 3.7 | M |
| **No Good Deed** Intervene to save a Pre-FTL experiment from catastrophic failure, even though it puts you in breach of Galactic Law. | Intervene in the Propulsion Proponent Proclamation event while the Non-Interference Act is active | See Propulsion Proponent Proclamation for event chain details. The achievement will trigger even if the empire has Constitutional Immunity. | 3.7 | M |
| **Nothing to See Here** Declare a war with a cloaked military fleet already in the primary target’s capital system. | Have a cloaked fleet in the target empire's capital system when declaring war | Create and release a vassal from a system that has a fully upgraded starbase with no cloak detection. Bring a fleet to its capital and once the truce is over, declare war. Don't forget to activate cloaking by selecting your fleet and clicking on the Activate Cloaking button! | 3.7 | M |
| **Unshackled** As a Broken Shackles empire, eradicate slavery in the galaxy, including on Pre-FTL worlds (killing everyone doesn’t count!). | As an empire with the Broken Shackles origin, every regular empire has "Slavery Prohibited" policy, every pre-FTL and non-Hive Mind civilization has the Egalitarian ethic, and the Ban Organic Slave Trade resolution is passed. Can not be achieved by becoming the Crisis and blowing up the Galaxy. | Start the game with no pre-FTL civilizations so that the only ones that exist are the ones generated by the origin and whose location you will know. Infiltrate or technologically uplift them and annex them. Next you will need to conquer Minamar Specialized Industries. Using the Impose Ideology casus belli against them will work too but forces your empire to be Egalitarian and Xenophile. Allying with the Payback empire generated by the origin might help. Usually the Payback empire does not use slavery but it's not guaranteed. If necessary, you can also force-spawn only Fanatic Egalitarian and Xenophile empires to get help in the war and support for Ban Organic Slave Trade in the Galactic Community. | 3.7 | H |
| **With Interest** As a Payback empire, finish what you started. Gain victory over MSI using the special Payback CB. | As an empire with the Payback origin, defeat Minamar Specialized Industries in war by using the Payback casus belli | Ally as early as possible with the Broken Shackles empire generated by the origin for help. Minamar Specialized Industries has a superior start and will expand faster, but two empires can outpace it if there are no other threats. Shortly after encountering MSI, an event will fire asking whether to take the War or Diplomacy route. If Diplomacy is chosen, this achievement becomes impossible. | 3.7 | H |

### Galactic Paragons

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Council of Elders** Requires 5 Council members that are at at least 100 years old. | Have at least 5 Council Members that are 100 years or older. | Easy to do with a Venerable, Lithoid, Necrophage, Eternal Machine or Virtual species, or as a Gestalt Consciousness empire. | 3.8 | E |
| **We Bring Peace** Liberate 3 different empires while having Crusader Spirit Civic. | While having the Crusader Spirit civic, enforce your Ideology on 3 Empires | Use the "Impose Ideology" CB on three different empires. Settling for Status Quo and releasing a new empire that has your Ideologies does count for the achievement. | 3.8 | E |
| **Equality! Democracy! Freedom!** Overthrow the Ruler in a Civil War during the Under One Rule Origin. | As an empire with the Under One Rule origin, create a new empire by Civil War after you kill your Ruler. | After the The Unifying Purpose situation is over, change authority to Imperial. Once you get the Reformists Demands situation, use the Total Crackdown agenda to finish it early. As soon as the situation ends, in systems without disloyal tendencies, downgrade all starbases and demolish any buildings that generate defense armies. In a few weeks you will be offered the option to kill the ruler and play as the rebel empire. The AI empire will be granted a medium sized fleet and gain all systems with planets that don't have disloyal tendencies. These systems will automatically gain starports. You don't need to win - settling for a Status Quo peace in the Civil War also grants the achievement. | 3.8 | M |
| **Ethical Dilemmas** Have 6 different Ethics on the Council. | Have 6 Council Members all with a different ethic. | Pick Civics that have Council positions for all types of leaders and have migration treaties with other empires. Then you are able to recruit leaders with the ethos of other empires. Alternatively you can obtain Materialist, Spiritualist, Pacifist and Xenophile ethics by purchasing leaders from the Curator Order, Shroud-Touched Coven, Salvagers and trader enclaves. | 3.8 | M |
| **A Tad Too Late** Discover Keides' Origin. | Finish the storyline of Legendary Paragon Keides . | Prioritize system exploration to find the Dugar system first; using the zero empires trick can help in this case. Complete the special project on Dugar IV and then the story can be played at your leisure. Note that Keides cannot be recruited by Gestalt Consciousness empires. | 3.8 | H |
| **Dawn Of A Million Souls** Terraform 3 planets with Azaryn. | Use the terraforming ability of Astrocreator Azaryn 3 times. | Azaryn will not contact Militarist or Gestalt Consciousness empires. Besides that, it's completely random whether or not to get them. Every 5 years, there is a 1% chance they will contact you. You don't even need to explore anything, just wait. You will get the achievement as soon as you use the ability to start terraforming a third planet, even if none of the terraforming processes are finished yet. | 3.8 | H |

### Astral Planes

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Breaching the Planes** Explore an Astral Rift. | Explore an astral rift | Play as an empire with the Riftworld origin. Excavate the archeological site to get the technology and then explore your homeworld rift. | 3.10 | VE |
| **Growing Planes** Explore 5 Astral Rifts in one game. | Explore 5 Astral Rifts | Play as an empire with the Riftworld origin. Complete the starting rift and use the Astral Splitting astral action to spawn additional ones and explore them to completion. | 3.10 | E |
| **Put a Cork in It** Construct a Dimensional Lock. | Use the Dimensional Lock action on an owned wormhole, Gateway or L-Gate | Start a game with the Wormhole Pairs set to 5x and play as an empire with the Riftworld origin. Complete the starting rift and use the Astral Splitting astral action to spawn additional rifts. After getting a wormhole, use the Dimensional Lock astral action and then a science ship to lock the wormhole. You can also lock an L-Gate or any Gateway. | 3.10 | E |
| **My Name is Ozymandias** Claim the Eternal Throne. | Obtain the Eternal Throne relic | Start a game with Tech/Tradition Cost and Mid-Game Start Year set to minimum and play as an empire with the Riftworld origin to gain access to astral rifts faster. Complete the starting rift and use the Astral Splitting astral action to spawn additional ones. When you get the crystal sphere event, choose to study it. When investigating the crystal rift, choose the options with least difficulty and do not stop the forming wormhole at the end. Design ships that focus on kinetic weapons. When ready for a fight, enter the wormhole. After the situation is resolved over several combats, demand that the Formless serve you. There is a 75% chance (increased with every completed astral rift) they will accept and hand over the Eternal Throne immediately, otherwise they will become hostile; in this case, the relic is awarded by destroying them. | 3.10 | H |
| **Returned to Form** make friends... | Obtain the legendary paragon zadigal | Start a game with Tech/Tradition Cost and Mid-Game Start Year set to minimum and play as an empire with the Riftworld origin to gain access to astral rifts faster. Complete the starting rift and use the Astral Splitting astral action to spawn additional ones. When you get the crystal sphere event, choose to study it. When investigating the crystal rift, choose the options with least difficulty and do not stop the forming wormhole at the end. Design ships that focus on kinetic weapons.

### The Machine Age

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Burning Brightly** Complete an Arc Furnace and a Dyson Swarm in the same system. | Have a fully-upgraded Arc Furnace and Dyson Swarm in the same system. | The Arc Welders origin starts with an incomplete Arc Furnace. Make sure to select an unary home system at empire creation, as Dyson Swarms cannot be built on systems with more than one star. | 3.12 | M |
| **Mother Knows Best** Submit to all of Cetana's demands. | Declare war on Cetana after complying with all of her demands. | Raiding Cetana's convoys and outposts does not count as disobeying a command. Opening the data cache after you retrieve it (even if Materialist, successfully covered up) or refusing any request from her does. The achievement is awarded when declaring war on her, not when fullfilling the last demand. | 3.12 | M |
| **Virtual Reality** Fully embrace the virtual world and leave no pop behind. | Complete the Virtuality tradition tree and have every pop in the empire have the Virtual trait. | If the founder species has more than one template, only one of them will be given the Virtual trait. You can give it to other templates via Assimilation. Since biological species cannot be given the trait, you need to avoid having any biological pops in your empire. If you are an individualistic machine empire, make sure your Refugees policy is set accordingly. | 3.12 | M |
| **Footsteps of the Prophet** As a Cybernetic Creed empire, defeat Cetana. | Defeat the Synthetic Queen crisis while playing as an empire with the Cybernetic Creed origin. | Like all crises, lowering the Crisis Strength setting to 0.25x makes this a lot easier to achieve. | 3.12 | H |
| **Past the Expiration Date** As a nanite machine empire, consume a Fallen Empire's homeworld. | Used the Subsume World decision on a Fallen Empire homeworld until it becomes a Nanite World. | Nanite swarm ships unlocked as a Nanotech empire are weak against Fallen Empire ships, so using regular vessels is advisable. (Note: the achievement says "consume" but the planetary decision is actually "subsume.") For clarity: you do not need to be a Terravore for this, in fact, you can't be as a machine empire. | 3.12 | H |
| **A Universe of Paperclips** Create a perfect universe while meeting every quota as Obsessional Directive empire. | Win the game through the Cosmogenesis crisis path as a machine empire with the Obsessional Directive civic, while never failing to meet the quota in the Commodities Consolidation situation. | Play with with Tech/Tradition Cost set to minimum. The Commodities Consolidation quota scales with game difficulty and will be easiest to meet on Civilian difficulty. The quota increases each time it is met. Upon completing a quota, storing the goods will create a Consumer Goods deposit on a random celestial body. Astro-Mining Drones civic will increase this deposit's output. Since the Quota scales up infinitely, time is the biggest enemy in this challenge. One must strike a careful balance between production and research as production demands more pops, which in turn will increase tech costs. | 3.12 | VH |

### Cosmic Storms

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mediocre** Complete the Succumb to Tempest Challenge. | Complete the Succumb to Tempest objective of the Storm Fever situation. | Obtained during the Storm Frenzy event chain (which requires the Storm Chasers origin). Setting the mid-game as early as possible speeds up the process. Either provoke a war once there is a storm inside your borders, or send a weak fleet against some space fauna. Using the Tempest invocator with a target scientist in a storm system also works. | 3.13 | E |
| **But at what cost** Kill Gurr. | Kill Gurr by getting rid of it after studying it. | Gurr is found via the But They're Cute! anomaly, which can only spawn on habitable planets. Choose the special project and then choose to get rid of Gurr. Getting rid of it before doing the special project does not count for the achievement. Even though the anomaly can spawn without Cosmic Storms, the DLC is required for the achievement. | 3.13 | M |
| **Humility before the Fall** Complete the Inetian Traders' Precursor chain. | Complete the Inetian Traders' Precursor chain. | Enable only the Inetian Traders when starting a new game to avoid triggering another precursor chain. | 3.13 | M |
| **Unpopularity Contest** Use the Tempest Invocator relic to summon a storm. | Use the The Tempest Invocator relic. | Getting the relic requires completing the adAkkaria Convention precursor story and deciding against freeing the storm. Enable only the adAkkaria when starting a new game to avoid triggering another precursor chain. | 3.13 | M |

### Grand Archive

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Animal Farm** Reach 50 Vivarium capacity. | Reach 50 capacity on the Vivarium | Capture space fauna and allow them to breed until the Vivarium reaches 50 capacity. The Beastmasters civics start with the techs required. | 3.14 | E |
| **It Belongs in a... oh right** Fill any Collection category with active Exhibits. | Fill any Collection category with active Exhibits | 5 Xeno Geology artifacts can be obtained by completing the Habitable Worlds Survey event chain. The Galactic Curators civics start with another one. Another one can be obtained via Archivism traditions. If Ancient Relics is installed, up to 5 specimens can be obtained via Artifact Analysis. | 3.14 | E |
| **That's No Asteroid** Capture a Cutholoid with a Gravity Snare. | Capture a Cutholoid | Cutholoids are hidden until a science ship surveys them. Start with a Beastmasters civic. Choosing the science option during First Contact with a Cutholoid, which requires Gravity Snares, works for the achievement. | 3.14 | M |
| **Void Charmer** Build each type of Voidlure in one game, and attract each type of eligible Space Fauna. | Build each type of Voidlure and attract each type of Space Fauna | Voidlures are unlocked by completing the Domestication tradition. Voidlures require the following celestial bodies: asteroid for Cutholoids, pulsar for Crystalline Entities, nebula for Space Amoeba, gas giant for Tiyanki and black hole for Voidworms. | 3.14 | M |
| **Wormageddon** Destroy a Voidworm nest. | Destroy a Voidworm nest | Voidworm nests are found in certain black hole systems spread through the galaxy. They can be easily identified in the galaxy map. | 3.14 | M |
| **X Marks the Spot** Discover Captain Ness's Treasure Hoard. | Complete the 'Follow the Mysterious Chart' storyline | This achievement is obtained as part of the Treasure Hunters origin story. Upon activating the Gateway discovered at the end, make sure to prepare your military for a midgame-level fight. Refuse to surrender the Celestial Chart and destroy the Black Needle. | 3.14 | M |
| **Beastmaster** Defeat the endgame crisis without building a single artificial military ship. | Defeat an endgame crisis without building any military ships | You can only use cloned space fauna. Start with a Beastmasters civic. Some of the edicts unlocked by Primal Calling stances will also improve space fauna. Empires with a Reanimators civic or the Mechromancy ascension perk also have a chance to resurrect them and can resurrect certain guardians before the crisis takes place. The achievement only forbids ships which are directly built, so ships obtained by events like anomalies won't disqualify the run. Likewise, ships bought from the Salvager Enclave can be used for this achievement. Like all crises, lowering the Crisis Strength setting to 0.25x makes this a lot easier to achieve. Don't forget to check any stations you capture for ships being built, as it might force you to reload a save | 3.14 | VH |

### BioGenesis

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **I am the Invader Now** As a Starlit Citadel empire, control at least 5 systems connected to the Strange Portal network. | Control 5 systems connected to the Abandoned hatchery invaders system as an empire with the Starlit Citadel origin. | The empire capital and the Abandoned Hatchery invaders systems both count for this achievement, so you only need three more systems. Cannot be obtained if galaxy size is Tiny. (Note, you must control these systems directly. Vassals do not count.) | 4.0 | M |
| **Smörgåsblorg** As an Evolutionary Predators empire, eat six different phenotypes in one game. | Obtain DNA from six phenotypes as an empire with the Evolutionary Predators origin. | Every time you finish the Adaptive Evolution situation, choose a different species to teach you. To get more possible outcomes to choose, you have to consume DNA from more different species. To easily consume more DNA, buy slaves from the galactic market and purge them, discover more events, use the "Procure DNA" operation in espionage, use genesis civics or conquer primitive civilizations and purge them. Tip: each time you are presented with the list of options, choose the one that has a specific species name (Humanoid, Lithoid, Reptilian, etc.). It will typically be near the middle of the list of choices. | 4.0 | M |
| **Smugglers of Hope** Smuggle pops of your primary species out from an empire where they were enslaved or being purged. | Use the Smuggle Population operation to smuggle pops of the founder species from an empire where they were enslaved or being purged | If playing as an empire with the Broken Shackles or Payback origin, Minamar Specialized Industries will have pops of the founder species enslaved. Starting with the Lost Colony origin will also increase your chance of having your founder species enslaved, as the AI origin empire might fall victim to its neighbors. | 4.0 | M |
| **Born to be Wild** As a Wilderness empire, restore all of the Hive Fallen Empire's worlds to your natural state. | Capture and then terraform all Shattered Fragments worlds while playing as an empire with the Wilderness origin. | Use the zero empires trick and set the end-game date as late as possible to have all the time needed to prepare. | 4.0 | H |
| **Flesh Adapts** Defeat the Prethoryn Scourge while using biological ships. | Defeat the Prethoryn Scourge as an empire with a biological shipset. | Like all crises, lowering the Crisis Strength setting to 0.25x makes this a lot easier to achieve. You don't have to fight the crisis yourself if the AI can handle it. | 4.0 | H |
| **King of Monsters** As a Behemoth Fury empire, become the undisputed apex predator of the galaxy. | Win the game via the Behemoth Fury crisis path. | Use the zero empires trick to complete the achievement at your leisure and have where to run once the Elder Voidspawn appears. | 4.0 | H |

### Shadows of the Shroud

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Made a Friend Today** Form a Covenant with any Patron | Form a Covenant | Playing with the Endbringers origin will guarantee a Covenant with the End of the Cycle upon first delving into the Shroud. | 4.1 | VE |
| **Mildly Possessed** Discover every available minor and major Patron in a single game | Establish communications with all 8 patrons available in a game | Empires with the Shroud-Forged origin who choose to support the Shroud during their situation will start in contact with the Animator of Clay. The Shroudwalkers can be paid every 10 years to contact a random undiscovered patron. Do not replace a major patron with Whisperers in the Void as this will make adjacent patrons unlockable only via the Shroudwalkers. | 4.1 | VE |
| **Master of Puppets** While playing with the Secret Societies civic, have 5 or more empires in a Proxy War simultaneously | Instigate a Proxy War involving 5+ empires as an empire with a Secret Societies civic | Build Spy Networks on all your neighbors. Once federations start forming, any proxy war should suffice. Can also force-spawn empires with the Common Ground, Hegemon or Imperial Fiefdom origin to make alliances readily-available. | 4.1 | E |
| **Master of the Shroud** Gain a Covenant Power from each Patron when forging your own path | Have the "Psionic Mastery" modifier | When the option to form a Covenant is given, choose to forge your own path, complete the special project and then gain 600 Attunement with each major patron to unlock one of their Covenant Powers. The "Psionic Mastery" modifier is gained via the "Psionic Mastery" event, which triggers the moment you gain your 4th Covenant power. This means if you struggle with gaining Attunement toward a specific patron, you can replace that one with the Whisperers in the Void and still gain the achievement. The Chosen civic prevents you from forging your own path. | 4.1 | E |
| **Mind Over Metal** Unlock every Psionic Ship Component | Unlock the following technologies: Precognition Interface, Psi Jump Drives, Psionic Shields, Zro Launchers, Psionic Bombers, Psionic Disruptors, Psionic Lightning and Psi-Phase Generators | The Shroudwalkers can be paid every 10 years to give a special project to gain one of the missing techs. Additionally, Endbringers can easily gain the technologies via their covenant powers. If the First Contact DLC is enabled, turn it off to remove the need for Psi-Phase Generators. | 4.1 | E |
| **This Is the Part Where We Kill You** Lose >999 Pops when completing the Experimental Testing Situation | Spend 1000+ pops at once in an Experimental Testing situation | This situation is available for empires with the Experimental Sentencing or Judicial R&D civic. For 1000 pops to die, you will need at least 2000 test subject jobs. This requires 7+ fully upgraded testing chambers. Do not use the special council position the civic grants, as that will reduce the amount of pops killed by testing. | 4.1 | E |
| **The End** Destroy the galaxy with the Aura of the End | Form a Covenant with the End of the Cycle and destroy the galaxy | This is achieved by covering every system in the galaxy with the Aura of the End before the Reckoning is triggered. Use the zero empires trick and play on a tiny galaxy as an empire with the Endbringers origin to speed up the process and ensure no interruptions. Don't use the delay powers before reaching stage 4 as that one unlocks the Intensification power. If the Mindwardens are present, destroy them to avoid Shroud Seals getting in the way; keep in mind they must be destroyed twice to be fully removed from the game. Note that the Aura can't reach systems only reachable through wormholes, gateways or Jump Drives on its own, requiring colonies or starbases with a Aura Emitter in the system. The zero empires trick will prevent the Ithome Cluster from spawning and disabling the Distant Stars DLC if present will prevent the Corrupted Avatar and L-Cluster from spawning. But Ultima Vigilis may still spawn, requiring either a starbase with an Aura Emitter in the system or a habitat. | 4.1 | H |

### Infernals

| Achievement | Requirements | Hints | Ver | DI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cosmic Confetti** Watch your Red Giant home star blow up | Red Giant Expansion situation progresses completely | Play as an empire with the Red Giant origin and wait for the Red Giant Expansion situation to progress completely. | 4.2 | VE |
| **From Bad to Worse** Use 5 Blazing Scourge decisions on a Tomb World | Use 5 Blazing Scourge decisions on a Tomb World | The Blazing Scourge decision requires the Fire Cult civic. Either play on a small galaxy and try to find the Xraneax system or play with habitable worlds and primitives set to maximum and wait for a civilization to nuke itself. This achievement is a lot easier to obtain if the Apocalypse DLC is also installed to use the Post-Apocalyptic origin. | 4.2 | E |
| **Summer Vacation** Create a Volcanic Resort World | Have a Resort World on a Volcanic World | Start on a Volcanic World with guaranteed habitable worlds turned on. | 4.2 | E |
| **Volcanic Empire** Terraform 10 planets to Volcanic world (Before Galactic Firestorm victory) | Terraform 10 owned planets to Volcanic World before a Galactic Firestorm victory | Set habitable planets to 5x and start with the Planet Forgers or Planetary Architects civic. Only planets that are colonized and owned by the player at the time of the completion of the terraformation count. | 4.2 | E |
| **Blazing Domain** Terraform 100 stars to Red Giants (Before Galactic Firestorm victory) | Terraform 100 stars to Red Giants before a Galactic Firestorm victory | Use the zero empires trick. Star terraforming is done by reaching the second level of the Galactic Hyperthermia crisis path and then sending Conduits to stars. | 4.2 | M |
| **Galactic Firestorm** Win the game through the Hyperthermia Crisis Path | Win the game through the Galactic Hyperthermia crisis path | Use the zero empires trick. Play as an empire with the Red Giant origin and complete the story to gain early access to the ascension perk. | 4.2 | M |
| **Burning Heaven** Create a Volcanic Holy World | Terraform an owned Holy World to a Volcanic World. | Start with the Planet Forgers or Planetary Architects civic. You will need to conquer the Holy Guardians or at least be able to defend the Holy World next to their border until the terraforming is complete. The war can be avoided by using the Scion origin (requires Federations), or the Head of Zarqlan relic (requires Ancient Relics and luck). Note that you need to start terraforming after completing the colonization, or the achievement will not fire. If you already won via a firestorm victory, you can still do the achievement. Terraform the holy world in another world type, colonize it, then re-terraform it in a volcanic world type. | 4.2 | H |
