# Physics research

**Physics** is one of the three research areas. It consists of the following fields:

- Computing: research labs, research speed, science ships, ship computers, point-defense, sensors, espionage, Cosmogenesis advancement technologies.
- Field Manipulation: energy production, shields, cloaking devices, astral rifts, some strategic resources, cosmic storm manipulation.
- Particles: ship reactors, energy weapons, FTL travel, some strategic resources.

## Table usage

**Color indicators:** **Starter** , **Acquisition** , **Rare** , **Dangerous** , **Repeatable** .

**Notes:**

1. The table shows the default names/icons of techs. Flavor entry is displayed if accompanied by a change to effects/requirements.
2. If a tech was available as a research option as part of the last choice, then its (total) weight is **halved** in the coming choice.
3. The table denotes the base cost of a tech. Actual in-game tech cost scales with game settings and (number of colonized planets and population).
4. **To research techs of higher tiers, it is necessary to first acquire six or more techs of the preceding tier.**
5. Sorting the table by tiers places all **Starter** tech at the top and **Repeatable** end-game tech at the bottom.
6. Most icons also double as links. For more information about an unlocked effect (buildings, components, etc.), click on the accompanying icon.
