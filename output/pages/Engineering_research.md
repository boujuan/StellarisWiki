# Engineering research

**Engineering** is one of the three research areas. It consists of the following fields:

- Industry: mineral production, robotics, building construction, cosmic storm protection.
- Materials: armor, industrial buildings, strategic resources.
- Propulsion: kinetic and explosive weapons, thrusters.
- Voidcraft: ship types and hulls, starbases, strike craft, megastructures.

## Table usage

**Color indicators:** **Starter** , **Acquisition** , **Rare** , **Dangerous** , **Repeatable** .

**Notes:**

1. The table shows the default names/icons of techs. Flavor entry is displayed if accompanied by a change to effects/requirements.
2. If a tech was available as a research option as part of the last choice, then its (total) weight is **halved** in the coming choice.
3. The table denotes the base cost of a tech. Actual in-game tech cost scales with game settings and (number of colonized planets and population).
4. **To research techs of higher tiers, it is necessary to first acquire six or more techs of the preceding tier.**
5. Sorting the table by tiers places all **Starter** tech at the top and **Repeatable** end-game tech at the bottom.
6. Most icons also double as links. For more information about an unlocked effect (buildings, components, etc.), click on the accompanying icon.

### Voidcraft event technologies

The following technologies cannot be discovered by research draws and are added as permanent research options by events.

| | Technology | Cost | Tier | Effects / unlocks | Prerequisites | DLC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | **Nanite Repair System** A highly effective hull auto-repair system comprised of billions of microscopic nanomachines was found among the smoking remains of the Scavenger, and has been repurposed for our uses.
