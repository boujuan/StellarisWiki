# Species rights

**Species rights** determined how species are treated in an empire. The rights can be determined individually for each species and can be changed every 10 years. Default rights for new species in the empire can also be set, which can later be modified for individual species. What rights can be selected depends on whether the species is the founder species of the empire and what ethics , civics , policies , and authority the empire has. The set rights interface can be found from the species panel.

When a species template is created, it inherits the species right of the unmodified species. However, the template can be given separate rights afterwards.

## Citizenship

Citizenship represents the status of a species in an empire. It also affects pops' ability to seek refuge: empires can allow all refugees, granting them residence or full citizenship, or only accept refugees from species that already have full citizenship.

The founder species, as well as species from the same class if the empire has the Selective Kinship civic, always have Full Citizenship rights. Species with Full Military Service also have Full Citizenship if the empire has the Citizen Service civic.

### Disconnected drones citizenship

Pops with the Hive-Minded trait in empires without Hive Mind authority have a different set of citizenships available.

| Type | Pop effects | Living standards | Requirements | DLC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Undesirables** State records do not recognize the existence of this species. | All pops of this species are being purged | Non-Existent | Extermination disconnected drones policy | |
| **Bio-Trophy** Glory to organics. | Can take Bio-Trophy jobs | Mandatory Pampering | Rogue Servitor civic | |
| **Protected Drones** Severed from their collective consciousness, these drones are guided by little more than base instinct. | - Yes Can take Alien Zoo jobs<br>- Planets with Hive-Minded pops can build Alien Zoo buildings<br>- −50% Pop amenities usage<br>- −50% Pop housing usage | Protection | Sustain disconnected drones policy | |

### Assimilation

Assimilation is a special citizenship type where pops are changed over time to match the founder species of the empire. Each month 100 pops will be assimilated. The type of assimilation depends on the empire and the pop in question. Assimilation of biological species is not available to Genocidal empires. Assimilating an invaded primitive species will remove stellar culture shock modifiers. Species under assimilation will not generate Crime.

- Pops with the Hive-Minded trait cannot be assimilated by non- Hive Mind empires unless the trait can be removed.
- Pops with the Psionic trait will lose it if assimilated to add the Cybernetic or Hive-Minded trait.
- Pops with the Cybernetic trait will lose it if assimilated to add the Psionic trait.

Empires with a robotic founder species can also assimilate all robotic pops of different species. This will change their species to the founder species.

| Assimilation | Allowed if either | Allowed species |
|---|---|---|
| Add trait: Cybernetic | - Driven Assimilator civic<br>- Transubstantiation Synthesis tradition | Organic |
| Add or remove trait: Hive-Minded | - Bodysnatcher civic<br>- Engineered Genesis tradition<br>- Evolutionary Extrapolation tradition<br>- Planned Polymorphism tradition<br>- Genotype Regeneration tradition<br>- Inevitable Assimilation tradition<br>- Transubstantiation Synthesis tradition ( only) | Organic |
| Add trait: Psionic | Great Awakening tradition | Organic |
| Change species to: Mechanical founder species | Synthetic Age tradition | Organic Robotic |
| Change species to: Machine founder species | Machine founder species | Robotic |

## Sub-species integration

Sub-species integration decides whether sub-species that are not the default template will slowly be replaced by the default template.

| Type | Effect | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **Do Not Integrate** Each subspecies, a unique expression of the same genetic foundation, showcases a remarkable ability to diversity. | No Sub-species is not integrated into the default template | |
| **Integrate Into Default** A unified species finds simplicity and focus in a shared evolutionary trajectory by shedding the complexities of variety. | Yes Sub-species is integrated into the default template | No Default template |

## Living standards

Living standards represents how economically favored a species is, as well as the gap between different social strata. The higher the living standards of a Pop is, the more Consumer Goods it will use, but the happier it will be. Higher living standards also remove the penalties from unemployment . Happiness bonuses require the empire to not have a deficit of consumer goods.

Most living standards cannot be used for species with Undesirables citizenship unless their purge type is set to either Neutering or Synaptic Service.

| Type | Elite | | | | Specialist | | | | Worker | | | | Slave | | Other effects | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| **Decadent Lifestyle** Decadent Lifestyle prioritizes more resources and luxuries for privileged members of society. | +1.5 | +20% | +7 | +0.5 | +0.75 | +20% | +2 | +0.5 | +0.5 | +20% | +0 | +0.5 | No | | | Pleasure Seekers civic No Slaves citizenship |
| **Academic Privilege** Academic Privilege prioritizes the educated Population, to the general benefit of the sciences. | +1 | +15% | +6 | +0.5 | +1 | +15% | +2.5 | +0.5 | +0.25 | +0% | +0.5 | +0.2 | 0 | +0% | +10% Research from jobs | Materialist No Slaves citizenship |
| **Social Welfare** Social Welfare strives to improve the lives of the poorer Stratas through generous social policies. | +1 | +10% | +4 | +0.5 | +0.5 | +10% | +3 | +0.33 | +0.5 | +10% | +2 | +0.33 | +0.1 | +10% | +1 Unity from unemployed pops No unemployment happiness penalty | |
| **Decent Conditions** Decent Conditions ensures that most members of the species have what they need for an acceptable quality of life. | +1 | +10% | +5 | +0.5 | +0.5 | +5% | +2.5 | +0.33 | +0.25 | +0% | +1.5 | +0.2 | +0.05 | +0% | | |
| **Stratified Economy** Stratified Economy prioritizes the ruling classes at the expense of the impoverished masses. | +1 | +15% | +8 | +0.5 | +0.5 | +5% | +1.25 | +0.33 | +0.1 | −10% | −0.25 | +0.1 | 0 | −10% | | Authoritarian |

| **Non-Existent** This species is in the process of being purged, and Pops from it will have no Upkeep cost. | — | | | | — | | | | — | | | | No | | | Undesirables citizenship |

### Egalitarian standards

The following living standards are only available to Egalitarian empires. Empires that have the Shared Burdens or Worker Cooperative civics cannot use other living standards except Chemical Bliss and Non-Existent. Egalitarian standards affect all strata the same way and remove the penalties from unemployment.

| Type | | | | | Unemployed pop output | Other effects | Civic |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Utopian Abundance** Utopian Abundance ensures that every member of this species has access to nearly any type of luxury conceivable. | +1 | +20% | +4 | +0.5 | +1 Unity +1.5 Research | | |
| **Shared Burden** Shared Burden ensures an equitable distribution of resources between all members of society. Pops demote Strata much more rapidly. | +0.4 | +5% | +3 | +0.25 | +1 Unity | Time −45% Pop demotion time | Shared Burdens |
| **Employee Ownership** Employee Ownership guarantees every worker a democratic share in their enterprise. Living costs and social responsibilities are distributed evenly to all members. | +0.5 | +0% | +3 | +0.33 | | +5% Happiness with Adaptive Shareholder Schemes tradition | Worker Cooperative |

### Chemical Bliss

Chemical Bliss is a living standard available to all individualist empires for biological species after researching the Subdermal Stimulation technology unless the species has the Chattel Slavery or Domestic Servitude rights. It affects all strata with the following effects:

- +40% Happiness
- +1 Consumer Goods Upkeep per 100 pops ( +0.1 for slaves)
- −60% Job Efficiency
- Yes No unemployment penalties

Changing the living standards of a species from Chemical Bliss to anything else will give the entire species the Withdrawal Symptoms modifier, which reduces its happiness by −10% and its resource output by −20% for 5 years.

### Forced standards

The following living standards are obligatory when their conditions are fulfilled.

| Type | Upkeep | Happiness | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mandatory Pampering** This living standard enshrines a small population of organic beings as display pieces, through relentless and unyielding pampering. | +1 Consumer goods | +40%<br>Happiness<br>- −80% if Unemployed | Bio-Trophy citizenship |
| **Servitude** These synthetics are held in absolute servitude to their organic masters, and can be used or discarded at their whim. | No | No | - Robotic species<br>- Servitude AI policy |
| **Drone** While it may have little use for luxuries, a drone population still requires a great deal of resources to sustain itself. | No | No | - Gestalt Consciousness<br>- Full Citizenship or Machine Integration citizenship |
| **Protected** They are accepted by the system as long as they are valuable. | No | No | - Machine Intelligence<br>- Shroud-Forged citizenship |

#### Assimilation standards

The following living standards are used by all pops with Assimilation citizenship. All of them reduce happiness by −50% .

| Type | Assimilation |
|---|---|
| **Identity Sublimation** This species is becoming one with the unified mind. | Hive Mind or Driven Assimilator |
| **Transubstantiation Synthesis** This species is melding with the machine. | - Adding Cybernetic trait (and No Gestalt Consciousness)<br>- Assimilating into Machine founder species |
| **Transcendent Awakening** This species is awakening to its psionic potential. | Adding Psionic trait |
| **Hive Dissociation** This species is undergoing a difficult physiological separation from a Hive Mind. | Removing Hive-Minded trait |

### Dystopian Society

Empires with the Oppressive Autocracy must use this living standard except when forced as above.

| Pop type | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Consumer goods upkeep | +1.5 | +1.625 | +0.1 | +0.125 | +0.1 | 0 |
| Amenities usage | +45% | −35% | −35% | −100% | −100% | −100% |
| Amenities production | | | | −100% | −100% | −100% |
| Happiness | +25% | +10% | +10% | −200% | −200% | −200% |
| Political power | +10 | +0.5 | −0.5 | −0.25 | −0.75 | |
| Trade | +0.5 | +0.1 | +0.1 | +0.1 | +0.1 | |
| Unemployed pop happiness | −85% | −50% | −40% | −50% | −40% | |

In addition to the effects above, if the empire has a deficit of consumer goods, instead of gaining happiness, Elites lose −25% happiness and enforcers, telepaths, and colonists lose −75% happiness; the latter also lose their additional political power over their stratum. Enforcers, telepaths, and colonists also lose −75% happiness if there is a deficit of amenities on their planet, but do not lose their political power.

## Military service

Military Service determines a species' right to join the police or military and whether or not they can become military leaders.

- Founder species must always be set to Full Military Service
- Xenophobe empires cannot set alien species to Full Military Service, unless they have the Selective Kinship civic, in which case they can use Full Military Service for species from their founder species class.
- Robotic species can only be used for Military Service if the empire has the Artificial Specialists technology or a Machine founder species.

| Type | Military jobs | Commanders | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Full Military Service** They are doubtlessly among the most competent in our armed forces. | Yes | Yes | - Full Citizenship, Residence, or Machine Integration citizenship<br>- No Serviles trait<br>- No Non-sapient |
| **Soldiers Only** They make excellent soldiers - but command is better left to others. | Yes | No | - No Undesirables citizenship<br>- No Gestalt Consciousness |
| **Exempt** They serve better away from the battlefield. | No | No | - No Battle Thralls slavery type<br>- No Hive-Minded species if Hive Mind<br>- No Robotic species if Machine Intelligence |

## Colonization rights

Colonization Rights determines whether a species is allowed to board colony ships and whether existing colony ships with that species can colonize new worlds. Is the species rights are changed while a planet is being colonized with that species, the colonization process is canceled.

| Type | Requirements |
|---|---|
| **Colonization Allowed** Who are we to deny any species their place among the stars? Together we will drive back the darkness. | - No Serviles trait<br>- No Non-sapient<br>- No Undesirables citizenship<br>- If Mechanical, requires Artificial Specialists technology or Machine founder species<br>- If enslaved, is Battle Thralls or Indentured Servitude slavery type |
| **Colonization Forbidden** In a vast sea of cold emptiness, a habitable world is the greatest treasure of all. Not all are worthy to seize it. | No Founder species |

## Population controls

Population Controls determines whether a species is allowed to reproduce enough to grow new pops or only enough to ensure it will not die off.

| Type | Effect | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **No Populations Controls** A species that does not propagate itself is at an evolutionary dead end. | Allows species pop growth | - No Undesirables citizenship<br>- If Hive Mind, must be either:<br>  - Hive-Minded species<br>  - Necrophage origin |
| **Population Controls Enabled** Selective reproductive suppression fields are often referred to as the blunt instruments of demography. | - No Does not allow species pop growth<br>- −10% Happiness | - Population Controls policy set to Allowed<br>- No Xenophile<br>- No Broken Shackles<br>- No Founder species |

## Migration controls

Migration controls affect both migration between planets within the empire and migration to and from empires with a Migration Treaty. Migration controls do not affect manual resettlement.

| Type | Effects | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **Migration Controls Enabled** The free flow of pops can allocate resources efficiently, but sometimes what is necessary is not efficient. | - Unemployed free sapient pops may not automatically resettle<br>- Pops cannot be selected for biological growth on a planet unless already present | |
| **No Migration Controls** Just as our primitive ancestors wandered in search of a home, every being must be free to seek its destiny among the stars. | - Unemployed free sapient pops may automatically resettle<br>- Pops can be selected for biological growth on a planet if not already present | - No Undesirables citizenship<br>- No Livestock slavery type<br>- No Grid Amalgamation slavery type |

## Slavery type

Slavery type can be selected if the species has Slaves or Exploited Drones citizenship or the empire has the Slaver Guilds or Indentured Assets civic. Slavery type determines certain properties of an enslaved pop, such as which jobs they can be employed in. Slaves cannot take the Knights of the Toxic God unique jobs.

| Type | Pop effects | Potential jobs | Requirements | Banned by | DLC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Chattel Slavery** Chattel Slavery is the most common form of slavery in the galaxy. Whether for life or a limited time, unrestricted access to the labor of others is in some parts seen as a privilege with numerous counter-duties attached, and elsewhere considered a self-evident prerequisite for a functioning society. | - −30% Happiness<br>- +10% Resources from Jobs | Worker jobs | Individualist | Greater Than Ourselves (3) | |
| **Battle Thralls** Battle thralls are weaponized serfs, often trained from birth in the martial arts and conditioned for absolute obedience. In exchange for unquestioning military service, they are granted much more autonomy than other slaves and can be employed in a greater variety of jobs. | - −20% Happiness<br>- +20% Army Damage | - Worker jobs<br>- Enforcer<br>- Soldier<br>- Duelist<br>- Necromancer | - Individualist<br>- No Hive-Minded species | Balance in the Middle (4) | |
| **Domestic Servitude** Domestic servants spend much of their time tending to the needs of free Pops - some are assigned to individual domiciles, while others tend to public spaces. They tend to live alongside their masters, and thus require almost no dedicated housing. | −20% Happiness | - Worker jobs<br>- Entertainer<br>- Servant | - Individualist<br>- No Hive-Minded species | Balance in the Middle (4) | |
| **Indentured Servitude** They can theoretically pay off their debts and be freed, but their contracts are intentionally structured to make this a non-issue. | - −20% Happiness<br>- +50% Political power | - Worker jobs<br>- Specialist jobs except:<br>- No Enforcer<br>- No Entertainer<br>- No Duelist<br>- No Necromancer | - Individualist<br>- No Hive-Minded species | Balance in the Middle (4) | |
| **Livestock** Livestock is Pops! | - −40% Happiness<br>- −50% Housing usage<br>- −10% Political power<br>- Can construct Alien Zoos on planet | - Livestock<br>- Protected Fauna<br>- Gladiatorial Xeno | - Xenophobe or Hive Mind<br>- No Mechanical species<br>- No Noxious species | Greater Than Ourselves (3) | |
| **Grid Amalgamation** Combined with a form of fusion, we have found all the energy we will ever need. | −40% Happiness | Grid Amalgamated | - Machine Intelligence<br>- No Genesis Architects | Greater Than Ourselves (3) | |
| **Sapient Specimens** In their simplicity, they serve a greater purpose. | +10% Happiness | Organic Specimen | - Genesis Architects<br>- No Noxious species | Greater Than Ourselves (3) | |
| **Orderlies** These workers are responsible for the day-to-day care of those subjected to experimental procedures that often render them unable to care for themselves. | | - Worker jobs<br>- Orderly | Experimental Sentencing | Greater Than Ourselves (3) | |

## Purge type

Purging type is only available to species with the Undesirables citizenship. It determines how quickly or humanely the pops are purged. Every option besides Neutering requires the Purge policy to be set to Allowed.

Pops being purged can produce resources based on the purge type, for as long as the pop has the Undesirables citizenship, not just when the pop is being declined, meaning that a planet with a pop of Processing purge type will yield +6 , while a planet with 2 of these pops will yield +12 in total, until all undesirable pops have been purged. These monthly resources are modified by planet unique buildings in the same way as the associated jobs; for example an Energy Grid gives an additional +1 per pop under Chemical Processing .

The Fanatic Purifiers civic gives +2 unity for each pop being purged while the Devouring Swarm civic gives +2 society research per pop in addition to the resources said purge type may have.

Each planet has at most one pop at a time that is Declining ; purging is not the only way it can happen, but it generally takes priority. A decline progress bar goes from 0 to 100, and fills up at a rate depending on the purge type. When the bar fills up, an undesirable pop on the planet will be removed. Depending on the purge type, the pop has a chance to be displaced as a refugee , if it is eligible; otherwise it is killed. Most purge types also cause other empires to get opinion penalties towards the purging empire, provided they have enough Intel to know it is happening.

- All non-gestalt empires that have the same founder species as the purged pop will have their opinion of the purger reduced by −25 per pop, to a maximum of −1000 .
- All other empires will also have their opinion of the purger reduced by −5 , and Egalitarian or Xenophile empires who don't allow species-wide purges have it reduced by a further −5–15 per pop, to a maximum of −1000 .

| Type | Monthly decline | Effects | Happiness | Opinion loss | Refugees chance | Valid species | Requirements | DLC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Displacement** It's not that we drive them from their homes. Their homes are simply no longer theirs. | 25 | −50% Pop housing usage | −30% | no | 100% | - No Hive-Minded<br>- No Mechanical, unless the pops are sapient<br>- No Machine if Machine Intelligence<br>- No Cybernetic if Driven Assimilator | No Genocidal | |
| **Extermination** The extermination squads are efficient. The dissolution of entire populations naturally takes time, but they get the job done. | 100 | | −1000% | yes | 5% | All | - No Devouring Swarm<br>- No Terravore | |
| **Neutering** Think of it as a phasing-out of a people. Our nation goes to meet the future, only some will not be with us. | 10 | | −20% | no | 0% | - No Hive-Minded<br>- No Mechanical, unless the pops are sapient<br>- No Machine | - Individualist | |
| **Forced Labor** With this final sacrifice, they will at least have been of some use. | 50 | - +3 Food<br>- +3 Minerals | −1000% | yes | 25% | - No Hive-Minded<br>- No Machine | - Individualist | |
| **Processing** It is a sad but inescapable fact that some are destined to simply fuel the ambitions of their betters. | 50 | - +6 Food if species is biological<br>- +4 Minerals if species is lithoid<br>- +3 Alloys if species is robotic | −1000% | yes | 20% | - No Hive-Minded<br>- No Robotic, unless Devouring Swarm | No Machine Intelligence | |
| **Chemical Processing** They will soon attain a more efficient form. | 50 | +6 Energy | −1000% | yes | 20% | Biological | Machine Intelligence | |
| **Necrophage** Only the strongest may survive in a hostile galaxy. This way their journey may continue. | 20 | Time Pops are changed to founder species | −50% | yes | 25% | Biological | Necrophage origin | |
| **Maximize** The quota must be reached. | 50 | - −0.1 Energy<br>- +5 Consumer Goods | −1000% | yes | 20% | All | - Obsessional Directive<br>- Determined Exterminator or missed a quota | |
| **Synaptic Service** Duty calls and the brave and the bright answer its call. We bear our thoughts as torches, to banish the darkness of ignorance and superstition. Step Forth, brave ones, and Burn. | 100 | Resettles pops to Synaptic Lathe | −33% | yes | 5% | All | Owns a Synaptic Lathe | |
| **Sacrifice** | 50 | - +5 Unity<br>- +2 Zro | −1000% | yes | 20% | War enemy founder species | Devouring War casus belli | |
