# Districts

Districts are the first level of world development, and represent large areas of development on a planet dedicated towards a particular purpose. Each world can support up to four district types: a primary district and three secondary districts. Their effects stack with each district. The total number of districts that can be built on a planet is limited by district slots, which are equal to the planet size unless modified by traditions , planetary features , planet modifiers , or blockers . The number of mining, generator, and agriculture districts is further constrained by the deposit features on the planet. Each district increases empire size by a default amount of 0.5.

## Primary districts

Each planet has a primary district that can have 2 specializations. The primary district type depends on empire and planet class and will be converted if the world is terraformed or conquered by an empire which uses a different primary district. The number of districts that can be built is limited only by the number of free district slots on the world. The last primary district on the planet cannot be demolished or replaced.

## Resource districts

Resource districts provide some additional housing and create jobs that generate energy, minerals, or food. Each resource district can support a single resource specialization , typically unlocked after researching a certain technology.

### Planetary resource districts

The number of planetary resource districts that can be built is typically limited by planetary features , but can be expanded by planet modifiers or resource district buildings . Under certain conditions, resource districts buildings can be built without a planetary feature limit, limited only by the planet's total district capacity, similar to urban districts. These districts are not available to empires with the Wilderness origin.
