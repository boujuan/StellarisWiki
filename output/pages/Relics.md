# Relics

**Relics** are very powerful artifacts and trophies that an empire can collect through various means. Every Relic has a passive effect, as well as a powerful Triumph effect that requires resources. All Relics have a Triumph cooldown, during which no other relic can be activated. Most relics have a cooldown of 10 years, but some have a shorter one.

AI empires can also obtain and use relics. If an empire invades and captures the capital of another empire while using a casus belli other than Claim the Galatron , there is a 10% chance to steal one of the owned Relics. The chance is increased to 15% if the empire has the Barbaric Despoilers civic and 50% when using the Despoliation casus belli. Having medium level government intel on another empire allows one to know how many relics it currently owns.

Relics give large amounts of score, which can tip the balance in games with victory enabled. The Relics Collected score for empires in the victory tab can be used to deduce which empire has relics.
