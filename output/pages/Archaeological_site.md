# Archaeological site

**Archaeological sites** are discoveries across the galaxy, usually taking the form of ancient ruins, which can be excavated by empires for a variety of rewards.

With the Ancient Relics DLC, archaeological sites serve as the primary source of minor artifacts, and many chapters reward a number of them when completed. When that DLC is not enabled, sites which are still available may have an alternate reward or no reward for such chapters.

## Excavation mechanics

Excavating an archaeological site requires the site to be within the empire's borders and requires assigning a scientist and science ship to it. The scientist remains at the site and uncovers its secrets over the course of multiple chapters , with each chapter providing a part of the site's story. Certain archaeological sites are only revealed to the empire that discovered them and cannot be excavated by another empire.

| Result total | Outcome | Exp |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 14 | Completes the current chapter | 75 |
| 11 - 13 | Adds 2 clues for the next phase | 40 |
| 6 - 10 | Adds 1 clue for the next phase | 25 |
| 5 ≤ | May trigger an event, or no effect | 10 |

Excavation proceeds in phases of 90 days; this time can be modified by leader traits, and AI empires always take twice as long. At the end of each phase, a die is rolled, with a random result from 1 to 10; adding the current number of clues and the scientist's Archaeology Skill and subtracting the chapter's difficulty gives the total result, as in the following formula:

: Result = Die Roll + Scientist Skill + Bonus + Clues - Difficulty .

The scientist's skill is equal to the scientist's level, plus any modifiers from leader traits, including councilors and the **Curator Archaeology Lab** technology.

A result of 14 or greater completes the current chapter; a result of 11-13 adds two clues for the next phase, a result of 6-10 adds one clue, a result of 5 or less adds no clues. A result of 5 or less can also trigger various events – depending on the archaeological site and chapter. These events can be helpful: add clues, give loot, even remove the Substance Abuser leader trait (5% chance); or harmful: remove clues or even kill the scientist (~2.9% chance).

Completing the chapter gives the scientist 75 experience; finding two clues gives them 40 experience, one clue 25 experience. Even when finding no clues still gives the scientist 10 experience. Clues gained from events, however, do not automatically give experience.

Excavation of archaeological sites can be paused and resumed at any time with no penalty. If the system with the archaeological site is gained by another empire, that empire can continue the excavation from the current chapter, but cannot gain any rewards from already completed chapters, thus fully excavated archaeological sites cannot be re-excavated by another empire

Most sites have a 67% chance to leave a minor artifacts deposit when the excavation process is complete. If a deposit is created, its value has an 80% chance of being 1 , a 16% chance of of being 2 , and a 4% chance of being 3 . The scientist trait Antiquarian increases the chance of gaining any deposit by 5% per level, and slightly increases the chance of a higher level deposit as well.

### Excavation events

At the end of each phase, if the result is 5 or less, then one of the following events may happen:

- Excavating Scientist dies, lose −2 clues
- Archaeology team members die, lose −1 clues
- A dangerous situation is avoided, gain +3 clues
- Choice to pay 100 Energy to gain +3 clues or do nothing and lose −2 clues
- Excavating Scientist gains the Maimed trait

The events are flavored according to the type of archaeological site, but the effects generally remain constant. Some archaeological sites have additional special events or no random events.

### Whispers in the Stone

Whispers in the Stone is an archaeological site that will inevitably spawn for one empire. After an empire researched the Mineral Isolation technology, each time it researches a technology and has at least one Mining District on a planet without an archaeological site there is a 5% chance to trigger the Whispers in the Stone event on a planet. The event gives the option to add the Whispers in the Stone archaeological site to the planet or an Ore-Rich Caverns planetary feature. While the archaeological site is present the planet gains −50% Minerals from Jobs.

| **Ruined Reactors** | 1. 6x minor artifacts output ( 100~1000 ), replaced by 12x physics output ( 250~100000 ) if No<br>2. 12x minor artifacts output ( 150~2000 ), replaced by 18x physics output ( 350~100000 ) if No<br>3. 12x minor artifacts output ( 150~2000 ), replaced by 18x physics output ( 350~100000 ) if No<br>4. 12x minor artifacts output ( 150~2000 ), replaced by 12x alloys output ( 150~2000 ) if No<br>5. Adds a 10 deposit to the planet, removing research deposits if there are any. 18x minor artifacts output ( 250~5000 ), replaced by 18x energy output ( 250~5000 ) if No | Toxic Barren |
| **Subterranean Network** | 1. 12x society output ( 250~100000 ). Also 6x minor artifacts output ( 100~1000 ), replaced by 12x physics output ( 250~100000 ) if No<br>2. 12x society output ( 250~100000 ). Also 6x minor artifacts output ( 100~1000 ), replaced by 12x engineering output ( 250~100000 ) if No<br>3. 25% progress towards the Terrestrial Sculpting technology and 12x society output ( 250~100000 ), or 18x society output ( 350~100000 ) if it is already researched. 6x minor artifacts output ( 100~1000 ), replaced by 12x engineering output ( 250~100000 ) if No . Starts the Georadiation Terraforming event chain and creates special projects in two nearby systems. | Toxic No Toxic Terraforming Candidate |
| **Toxic Pools** | 1. 12x society output ( 250~100000 )<br>2. 12x society output ( 250~100000 )<br>3. 18x society output ( 350~100000 )<br>4. Choice of:<br>  1. Toxic Slime Catalyzation special project on the planet, which takes Time 6 months. If the empire is a Gestalt Consciousness or genocidal, finishing it grants 24x society output ( 500~1000000 ) and 25% progress towards the Living Test Subjects technology. If not, then finishing it creates 100 pops of a new toxoid species with the Slimespawn trait.<br>  2. 18x energy output ( 250~5000 ), replaced with 48x food output ( 700~30000 ) if toxoid. | Toxic |
