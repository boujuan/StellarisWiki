# Machine traits

Machine traits are available to species with the Machine and Mechanical primary traits. Empires with such a founder species can change machine traits at any point unless they have the Life-Seeded, Voidforged or Shattered Ring origin. Those empires, as well as empires with a biological founder species must research the Machine Template System technology to change machine traits.

## Climate preference traits

Each species has a climate preference trait that determines their base Habitability on the various types of planets, usually that corresponding to the type of their homeworld. Habitability traits can be changed through machine modification unless the species has the Waterproof trait. A pop can never have more than one Habitability trait.

Despite the values listed here, Machine and Mechanical traits granting minimum habitability means that habitability will never go below 50% . However, base habitability must still be increased to increase habitability above 50%.

| Preference | Dry | Wet | Cold | Volcanic | Other | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dry | 75% | 50% | 50% | 25% | | - Empire creation<br>- Machine modification |

| Volcanic | 50% | 50% | 0% | 75% | | |
| | | | | | | |
| Habitat | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Habitat: +80% | - Voidforged species<br>- Can be added through machine modification by Voidforged empires |
| Gaia | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Gaia World: +100% | - Life-Seeded species |
| Ring World | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Ring World: +100% | - Shattered Ring species |
| | | | | | | |
| Tomb | 60% | 60% | 60% | 0% | Tomb World: +80% | - Can only appear if Cetana's Heart relic generates a species on one of these worlds |
| Relic | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Relic World: +80% | |

| Synaptic Lathe | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Synaptic Lathe: +100% | |

## Origin traits

Origin traits are obtained by starting the game with a certain origin and do not cost any trait points. If a biological species completes synthetic ascension its origin trait will be replaced with the version for machine species.

## Basic traits

Basic traits can be selected when first creating a species, or changed through machine modification. They can all be changed later through machine modification, a few of them being restricted to Mechanical or Machine species.

Organic empires must research higher tiers of robot technologies before they can add some of the more advanced traits to Mechanical pops.
