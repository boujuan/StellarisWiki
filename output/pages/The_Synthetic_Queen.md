# The Synthetic Queen

The **Synthetic Queen** is one of the endgame crises . She is an extremely powerful synth whose goal is to bring an end to all suffering by ending sapience itself. She is the only crisis that is not immediately hostile, and unlike other factions, her crisis follows a situation that must be completed before she can be engaged. The Synthetic Queen's face depends on the founder species of the empire she is speaking to.

## Mechanics

Unlike other crises, the Synthetic Queen's spawn location can be predicted. It is picked in the following order the moment of her spawn:

1. The homeworld of the Militant Isolationists, unless it has been cracked or shielded
2. The capital of a non-machine Fallen Empire unless it is the overlord of a Scion empire. This may not be their homeworld if they lost it.
3. Any Relic World
4. Any Tomb World
5. Any habitable planet

The system where the Synthetic Queen spawns is protected by 7 starbases.

6 months later, every empire is notified about a power surge in the system where the Synthetic Queen spawns. Another 6 months later, she expands into all adjacent systems. A year later, she expands into all adjacent systems again, destroying the fallen empire if she spawned in the homeworld of one. Next year, the Synthetic Queen contacts all empires. She calls herself Cetana and appear as such in the Contacts menu, but she cannot be contacted.

Immediately after, Cetana declares Total War on all Fallen Empires if any exist in the galaxy. Empires who are Scions of the Fallen Empire receive a message from their overlord that changes their terms of agreement to "Overlord Conflicts: None" before the war.

While at war with Fallen Empires, the Synthetic Queen receives a new fleet every 6 months as long as she has fewer than 13.

The Synthetic Queen has a bonus +200% damage to Fallen Empires, Awakened Empires, and other endgame crises. Fallen Empires receive a debuff −90% damage to the Synthetic Queen.

When the Synthetic Queen expands into a system, all planets aside from gas giants are terraformed into nanite worlds. Those that were previously colonizable gain the Terraforming Candidate modifier while those that were not gain a deposit of 3 nanites. Habitable megastructures are destroyed and cannot be rebuilt. In addition, all ships in the system gain +5 chance to evade and −10% sublight speed. Unlike other crises, the Synthetic Queen is highly visible on the galaxy map, her systems having a unique visual effect.

If one of the Synthetic Queen's fleets bombards a planet until devastation reaches 100%, the planet is turned into a barren world with the Terraforming Candidate modifier. Habitable megastructures are destroyed and cannot be rebuilt.

After all Fallen Empires and their allies are destroyed, or roughly a year after she makes contact if she did not have Fallen Empires to fight, Cetana contacts all empires again and build an outposts in one of the systems bordering each empire, or one of their systems if there are no unowned systems in the galaxy. Those systems appear differently on the galaxy map. How each empire reacts to Cetana's actions affects her opinion. Cetana also becomes available for contact. In addition, every empire gains the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation and a free reward from Cetana. If the Grand Archive DLC is installed, she will also give every empire a Cetana's Love specimen.

If a fleet attempts to enter one of the Synthetic Queen's systems before she makes contact, the fleet goes MIA and the empire receives a special project that costs 10000 physics research. Otherwise, the project is offered after the Synthetic Queen makes contact. Completing the project adds 10% progress to the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation and the empire receives a second special project that costs 50000 physics research. Completing the second project allows entrance into the Synthetic Queen's outpost systems, adds another 10% progress to the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation and gives 500 nanites. Empires that adopted the Nanotech tradition tree receive an additional 500 nanites and unlock new dialogue options to gain the Cetana's Apprentice permanent empire modifier.

Within a year after Cetana constructs her outposts, every empire receives six to 10 special projects, depending on galaxy size. 5 projects are useful and the rest are empty. One special project is usually located within the empire's borders and is always useful, while the rest are located in random systems that are not controlled by Cetana. Each project requires a science ship and 500 days to complete. Completing a useful project adds 10% progress to the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation and has a 50% chance to create the Cetana: Unlikely Survivor archaeological site in the empire's home system. Completing an empty project grants a small amount of engineering, physics, or society research. A few months after all useful special projects have been completed, a special project is issued on an uninhabitable planet within the empire's borders. Completing it reveals the Cetana: Veiled Temple archaeological site .

Reaching the second stage on the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation removes the opinion penalty for raiding convoys and outposts. Finishing the situation gives the Bane of the Synthetic Queen permanent empire modifier and allows declaring war on Cetana.

Until the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation is completed, her fleets other than convoys and outpost guards cannot be attacked and the option to declare war on her is unavailable. Once any empire declares war, Cetana dismantles her outposts and leaves in place a fleet of 12 Heralds.

The crisis will end when Cetana's colossus is destroyed, at which point all her starbases and ships self-destruct. The empire that destroys the colossus gains the Cetana's Heart relic. If the empire has the Cybernetic Creed origin, it will be awarded the Footsteps of the Prophet achievement. If Cetana's colossus is destroyed before the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation is completed, (e.g. using a Behemoth or a high intensity Aura of Desire), the crisis can't be ended, and a game loss becomes inevitable.

## The Synthetic Queen's opinion

Cetana has an opinion value of all empires. It starts at 50 and can only be affected through events and dialogue choices. If her opinion rises above 75, she rewards the empire every 30 months with one of her rewards and loses 10 opinion. If her opinion falls below 25, she retaliates every 30 months until her opinion is increased above 25. Cetana punishes empires in the following order:

1. Every system gets −15% sublight speed and Tracking −10 tracking for 12 months
2. −75% Research speed for 30-40 months
3. Every system gets −30% sublight speed and Tracking −20 tracking for 30-40 months
4. Ruler is killed if the empire is not Gestalt Consciousness and Legion Node is killed if the empire is Gestalt Consciousness

## Cetana's Rewards

Whenever granting a reward, Cetana gives the empire 50% progress in one of the following technologies, adding them as a permanent research option:

- Ascension Theory
- Adaptive Armor Hardening
- Advanced Shield Hardening
- Mega-Engineering
- Jump Drives
- Dark Matter Deflectors
- Dark Matter Power
- Living Metal
- Artificial Dragonscales
- Enigmatic Encoder
- Enigmatic Decoder
- If all technologies were researched it gives the Cetana's Thought technology and any further rewards after that are random technologies

## Cetana's Work

Cetana's Work represents how close Cetana is to completing her plan. Once complete, the game ends for every empire. How fast it makes progress depends on the Crisis Strength setting. Cetana's Work progress is invisible until it reaches 50%, after which a progress bar is displayed under Cetana's name and relationship indicator in her dialog screen.

Around one year after Cetana constructs her outposts, every empire receives a request from her to retrieve a data cache located in the empire's capital system. Whether they accept or not, they receive a special project. If Cetana's request is accepted, the special project is available for 900 days. Otherwise, it is only available for 540 days. Once the special project is completed, the empire has the option to open the cache or send it to Cetana.

- Opening the cache makes Cetana's Work visible early and increases the progress of the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation.
- Not opening the cache after agreeing to help Cetana lets you choose a huge reward of basic resources, advanced resources, strategic resources, or another one of the technologies Cetana usually gives. An empire that refused to help Cetana does not receive any reward.
- Materialist empires have the option to hack into the cache and gain both rewards.

Once Cetana's Work reaches 80%, all empires declare war on her and become able to enter all her systems.

## Requests

Once the data cache special project is completed one way or another, Cetana begins to make a demand to all empires every 5 years. Giving her what she wants increases progress towards Cetana's Work . Cetana may request the following:

- 100 Pops. Can also offer 200 pops, 25 influence, and 2000 unity to gain 10% progress for the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation.
- 25% Alloys for a year. Can also offer 50% alloys for a year, 25 influence and 1000 unity to gain 10% progress for the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation and +5% naval capacity and +25% ship build speed for 2 years.
- 25% Research speed for a year. Can also offer 50% research speed for a year, 25 influence and 1500 unity to gain 10% progress for the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation.
- 1 uninhabitable system without a megastructure. Can also offer 2 systems, 50 influence and 2500 unity to gain 10% progress for the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation.
- 1 habitable system without a megastructure. Can also offer 2 systems, 100 influence and 3000 unity to gain 10% progress for the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation and +10% naval capacity and +50% ship build speed for 2 years.

If an empire has the Head of Zarqlan relic, Cetana asks for it after establishing her outposts. Accepting gives +20 opinion while refusing gives −20 opinion. Submitting to all of Cetana's requests before war is declared awards the Mother Knows Best achievement.

## Weak Links

After Cetana constructs her outposts, she periodically sends out convoys that travel between outposts and her capital. The frequency and limit of convoys scales with galaxy size. Every empire receives a situation log entry called Weak Links that lets them track and ambush the convoys. To ambush a convoy, a fleet requires at least 50k fleet power. Empires that complete the special project to enter Cetana's storm also receive a situation log objective that lets them raid the systems she claimed near the borders of empires. Each time a convoy or outpost is destroyed, the empire that raided it receives one of the following rewards:

- 30% chance to gain 10% progress for the Cetana: The Synthetic Queen situation and Cetana's Work is reduced.
- 12.72% chance to gain 400 pops from random species that exist in the galaxy
- 12.72% chance to gain scaled engineering research
- 12.72% chance to gain scaled physics research
- 12.72% chance to gain scaled society research
- 12.72% chance to gain 10000 alloys
- 6.36% chance to gain 1000 nanites
- Empires with the Barbaric Despoilers civic have a 5.8% chance to obtain 8000 alloys, 700 nanites and 300 pops from random species that exist in the galaxy

## The Synthetic Queen's fleets

The Synthetic Queen spawns with 6 fleets and Cetana's colossus. Each fleet contains 3 Defenders and 18 Heralds. Convoys and the fleets she spawns to protect the system bordering each empire contain 1 Defender and 6 Heralds. Fleets that spawn to protect demanded systems contain 18 Heralds. AI empires will only attack Cetana's colossus with fleets that have at least 100k fleet power.

## The Shroud ending

Empires that breached the Shroud and completed both crisis archaeological sites unlock a new interaction to reach out to the Animator of Clay when delving into the Shroud. The interaction costs 2000 energy and 500 Zro. Next, the empire must pay one of three prices: 27182 Zro, a planet, or the ruler. Paying the price disables Cetana's colossus and, once the fleets and starbase guarding the colossus are destroyed, starts a special project the requires bringing a transport ship next to it for a month. Completing the special project instantly defeats Cetana. Instead of the relic, the empire gains her colossus for itself.

Empires who formed a covenant with End of the Cycle or have the Shroud-Forged origin and trapped Animator of Clay will never receive this option.
