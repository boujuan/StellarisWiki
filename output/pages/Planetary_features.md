# Planetary features

Planetary features represent notable areas found on natural planets. They determine the number of Districts the planet can support and some features exclusively obtained by events can provide various bonuses to planets. If a planet is terraformed into an Ecumenopolis, Hive World or Machine World, it loses all of its planetary features, including event features. Hive Worlds and Machine Worlds do not lose the deposit features that determine the max number of Strategic Resource buildings.

## Features

### Deposit features

These planetary features are generated on each natural planet and determine the number of resource districts the planet can support. They are rerolled if the planet is terraformed but are likely to change into planetary features with the same effects that fit the new planet class. Each planet will have between 4 and 15 deposit features depending on planet size.

Dry planets are 50% more likely to have planetary features that increase the limit for Generator Districts, wet planets are 50% more likely to have planetary features that increase the limit for Agriculture Districts and cold planets are 50% more likely to have planetary features that increase the limit for Mining Districts.

Features that increase the max number of Agriculture Districts and Mining Districts cannot appear on Volcanic Worlds. Instead, they are replaced by features that increase the max number of Magma Conduits and Thermotechnic Forums.

#### Strategic resource deposits

Strategic resource deposits increase the maximum number of districts and if the required extraction technology is researched, add additional strategic resource output to jobs and unlock a strategic resource specialization. Each planet can only have one strategic resource deposit for each resource and they cannot appear on homeworlds, with exception for certain origins. They are 50% more likely to appear on their favored planet class and 100% more likely to appear on Gaia Worlds.

## Blockers

Blockers are obstacles that reduce Max Districts, and may block some planetary features from being exploited. They can be cleared by spending resources and time and some of them may have rewards when cleared. Clearing can be done while the planet is being colonized or after the colony is completed.

Blockers have a yellow border if they can be removed, and a red border if they cannot be removed due to missing technology or other requirements.

If a natural planet is terraformed into a planet class other than Ecumenopolis, all of its blockers are cleared and rewards are given. If it was terraformed into Hive World or Machine World, the planetary feature it unblocks will be lost.

### Natural blockers

These blockers can be found on habitable planets . Most of them require a certain New Worlds technology to be cleared. Ranger jobs will produce additional resources for each natural blocker.
