# Land warfare

Wars are not decided in space alone. To secure ultimate victory, one must seize control of enemy planets, and to capture enemy worlds, entire armies are needed, along with the preparation and stratagems to properly use them. Worlds may only be invaded if the system's starbase has been occupied.

## Orbital bombardment

Orbital bombardment occurs when a fleet is in orbit around a hostile world, and causes damage to any armies but also kills pops, causes Devastation and has a chance to ruin districts or buildings. Effectiveness is based on the fleet size of the fleet in orbit, although it suffers diminishing returns after 100 and every 10 planet size halves damage from orbital bombardment. The more pops and buildings a world has relative to its size, the more damage it receives from orbital bombardment. Enemy assault armies on the planet take double damage from orbital bombardment.

If orbital bombardment destroys the last army, the world has a chance to surrender if the attacking empire has the Allowed Orbital Surrender Acceptance policy. Worlds from Gestalt Consciousness empires will never surrender.

While a hostile fleet is orbiting a world, defense armies cannot respawn and Devastation does not decrease.

## Combat

Ground combat takes place between the world owner's armies and the invader's armies. It takes 10 days for armies in orbit to land on a world. The number of armies that can be engaged in combat on either side is five plus one-fifth (20%) of the planet size. Excess armies are initially placed in a reserve area behind the frontline and replace any disengaged or destroyed armies as combat progresses.

Each day, each army engaged in combat deals its health and morale damage to a randomly selected enemy army; armies with less than 50% health are twice as likely to be selected. Armies below 50% health may also disengage from battle; this moves them from the frontline area to the reserve area. Disengaged armies cannot return to the frontline but can still be attacked by enemy armies and destroyed, although they are half as likely to be selected as the target of an enemy army.

Unless an army is immune to morale damage, when its morale drops below certain thresholds, the army is negatively affected by the following modifiers:

| Morale perc. | Penalty |
|---|---|
| < 50% | −25% Army damage |
| 0% | −75% Army damage |

After 30 days, the attacker can choose to retreat at any time. However, there is a chance that each retreating army is destroyed while attempting to return to space, with the chance increasing as the army is more damaged. This makes retreating a risky endeavor and something to do only in particularly serious emergencies. A small amount of war exhaustion is gained for each assault army that is destroyed. Some types of assault armies cause more or less war exhaustion upon their demise.

As long as the ground combat is ongoing, it is possible for either side to land reinforcements, though typically this is only feasible for the attacker. The ground combat ends when the attacker retreats or all armies of either side are destroyed. If assault armies land on an enemy planet with no opposing armies present, then the planet is captured instantly and occupied with no combat taking place.

### Army rank

| Rank | XP | Effects |
|---|---|---|
| Regular | 0 – 100 | None |
| Experienced | 100 – 1000 | - +10% Damage<br>- +10% Morale |
| Veteran | 1000 – 10000 | - +20% Damage<br>- +20% Morale<br>- +10% Health |
| Elite | ≥ 10 000 | - +40% Damage<br>- +40% Morale<br>- +20% Health |

As armies fight battles, they will increase in rank, improving their stats based on their experience points. Armies get +2 experience points each time they deal damage and +1 when they take damage. Army starting experience can be increased by +100 by each of the following:

- Strength of Legions civic
- Private Military Companies civic
- Dread Encampment building
- Mercenary Liaison Office Corporate holding
- Pirate Free Haven corporate holding

### Army stat modifiers

In addition to army rank, several technologies, civics, species and leader traits, and other sources affect army damage, health, and other stats. Additionally, Commanders provide +5% army damage per level and plus other bonuses from traits. Modifiers from species traits affect armies recruited from that species, while Commander and Official traits affect armies led by that general or on world's in that governor's sector.

## Defense armies

Defense armies are automatically recruited by certain jobs that spawn them, based on the species working that job. Defense armies cannot be moved from the world they are recruited on and are used only to defend against enemy armies. While they are stronger one-for-one than assault armies, do not cause War Exhaustion when destroyed and they do not cause Collateral Damage when fighting, their limited recruitment means that significant investment is necessary to fend off a concentrated attack.

The type of army recruited depends on the pop working the building that spawns them. Defense armies do not incur any upkeep beyond that of the building and pop which creates the army. The most powerful army available will always be the one recruited.

| Type | Base Damage | Morale Damage | Health | Morale | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Defense Army** Defense armies are powerful, but cannot be transported from the planet. | 2.25 - 4.50 | 2.25 - 4.50 | 250 | 250 | Biological pops No Wilderness |
| **Presapient Herd** Deeply territorial creatures who remain docile until provoked, at which time they are unburdened by all but the most basic instincts to defend those they recognize as kin. | 2.25 - 4.50 | 2.25 - 4.50 | 250 | 250 | Wilderness |
| **Robotic Defense Army** Cold and heartless killing-machines designed only for war. They pursue their objectives relentlessly, and are impervious to the shattering effects of poor morale that so often plague organic combat units. | 1.50 - 3.00 | 1.50 - 3.00 | 250 | Immune | Mechanical pops |
| **Defense Android Army** These androids are experts in defensive warfare and are adept at upholding law and order in emergencies. | 1.65 - 3.30 | 1.65 - 3.30 | 250 | Immune | Individualist Machine pops |
| **Drone Grid** These autonomous sentinel drones will incessantly patrol their assigned sectors. Though lightly armed and not very intelligent, they are legion. | 1.65 - 3.30 | 1.65 - 3.30 | 220 | Immune | Machine Intelligence |
| **Undead Defense Army** Undead soldiers lifted from the grave by necromancers, brought back to life to protect our planets from all that might threaten them! | 2.25 - 4.50 | 3.93 - 7.87 | 350 | Immune | Necromancer jobs present |
| **Offspring-Led Army** Under the direct supervision of the local Offspring, the armies are both deadlier and more challenging to kill than anything a regular hive-mind could produce. | 2.62 - 5.25 | 3.41 - 6.82 | 400 | Immune | Offspring Drone jobs present |
| **Fanatic Guardians** Stoic defenders of our homeland, these unshakeable soldiers are most effective when protecting those with whom they share a close relationship. | 4.50 - 9.00 | 4.50 - 9.00 | 500 | 500 | Individualist Sovereign Guardianship |
| **Matrix Unit** These highly lethal protective drones are most effective kept in close proximity to all other strategic nodes. | 3.30 - 6.60 | 6.60 - 13.20 | 440 | Immune | Guardian Cluster, Gestalt Sovereign Guardianship |
| **Sentinels** Living statues with a mechanical core, bodies humming and skin glowing, radiation pulsating from their cores, ready to rain destruction on their enemies! | 6.00 - 12.00 | 30.00 - 60.00 | 1400 | Immune | The Sentinels archaeological site |
| **Titanic Guardian** While less aggressive than the Titanic Beast, the Titanic Guardian is still a powerful defensive fighter. | 3.00 - 6.00 | 6.00 - 12.00 | 1000 | 600 | Titanic Lifeforms event chain |

### Pre-FTL armies

Pre-FTL armies are only used by primitive civilizations. They are weaker than any army and even the strongest Pre-FTL army can easily be defeated by an equal number of any regular army.

| Type | Base Damage | Morale Damage | Health | Morale | Ages |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primitive Army | 0.15 - 0.30 | 0.15 - 0.30 | 100 | 160 | Bronze Age - Steam Age |
| Industrial Army | 0.60 - 1.20 | 0.60 - 1.20 | 100 | 160 | Industrial Age - Machine Age |

| Ketling Army | 0.90 - 1.80 | 0.90 - 1.80 | 200 | 200 | Pre-FTL Ketlings |

## Assault armies

An empire can recruit assault armies from a world based on the species living there. The species must not have the Exempt Military Service species rights or the Tankbound trait to recruit an army from it. The number of assault armies that can be recruited by an empire from a species is equal to 1% of the total number of pops of that species living in the empire (which equates to 1 army for every 100 pops), with the exception of Clone Armies and Undead Armies. Armies not tied to a species, such as the Xenomorph Army, are unlimited unless otherwise specified.

Unlike defense armies, assault armies are based mostly in space; each assault army comes with its own transport ship , which is used to carry them to their destination. Each assault army will board its transport ship when recruited and will be based aboard that transport ship when not stationed on a planet. Transport ships are unarmed but automatically upgraded with the latest defense and utility components, including cloaking devices. Assault armies can be ordered to land on an enemy planet to initiate an invasion and planetary battle to gain control of it, and they can also be ordered to land on any owned or allied world to provide additional defense.

Assault armies have a chance to cause Collateral Damage when fighting, which will increase planet Devastation and have a chance to kill pops, ruin buildings or destroy districts. The chance to kill pops scales with the number of pops on the planet, however the last 300 pops cannot be killed by Collateral Damage. Assault armies that are defending a planet cause 75% less Collateral Damage.

## Devastation

Devastation is a measure of damage inflicted on a world's infrastructure from war. Values range from 0 to 100% . Every 1% Devastation causes a 1% decrease in housing, amenities, trade, resources from jobs, Upkeep upkeep from jobs and pop growth speed. Pops will not automatically resettle to a world that has at least 10% Devastation or more.

Devastation is primarily caused by orbital bombardment and, to a lesser degree, by Collateral Damage from armies. Assault armies have a Collateral Damage modifier that quantifies how quickly they cause devastation.

Devastation decreases by 0.05% daily if the world is not being invaded or orbited by a hostile fleet.
