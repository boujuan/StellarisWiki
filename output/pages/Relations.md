# Relations

All regular and fallen empires have a bilateral **Relation** with each other empire. The relation level between two empires is based on the sum of their unilateral opinions of each other, and it primarily determines which diplomatic actions are available between two empires without requiring an Envoy to be sent to Improve or Harm Relations.

The unilateral opinion of an empire also influences whether an AI empire supports or opposes proposed resolutions in the Galactic Community as well as their attitude towards an empire.

## Relation levels

The relation level between two empires is determined by the sum of the opinions both empires hold towards each other and determines what diplomatic options are available without requiring an Envoy to improve or harm relations.

|---|---|---|---|
| Terrible | −3000 to −750 | - Rivalry<br>- Insult | Our empires consider each other enemies. We cannot realistically expect to come to agreement on any issues. |
| Tense | −750 to −300 | Insult | Diplomatic efforts are breaking down. We are unlikely to come to an agreement on most issues. |
| Neutral | −300 to +300 | Embassy, Guarantee Independence, Non-Aggression Pact, Trade | Our diplomatic infrastructure is rudimentary. We can only expect agreement on deals that strongly benefit the other side. |
| Positive | +300 to +750 | - Embassy, Guarantee Independence, Non-Aggression Pact, Trade<br>- Commercial Pact, Defensive Pact, Federation Associate, Migration Treaty, Research Agreement | Diplomatic efforts are beginning to pay off. We are beginning to find common ground on many diplomatic issues. |
| Excellent | +750 to +3000 | - Embassy, Guarantee Independence, Non-Aggression Pact, Trade<br>- Commercial Pact, Defensive Pact, Federation Associate, Migration Treaty, Research Agreement<br>- Federation, Secret Fealty, Subjugation | Our envoys have forged strong ties with this empire. Our empires are eager to work together diplomatically. |
