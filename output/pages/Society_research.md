# Society research

**Society** is one of the three research areas. It consists of the following fields:

- Biology: food production, genetic modification, leader lifespan and enhancement, biological ship components, army types.
- Military Theory: fleet command limit, naval capacity, army buildings and stats, claim cost.
- New Worlds: habitability, terraforming, blocker removal, starbase capacity, upgraded capital buildings.
- Statecraft: unity and edicts, leaders, envoys, diplomacy, upgraded capital buildings, various buildings for unity, trade and amenities.
- Psionics, exotic technologies unlocked in mid to late game, associated with psionic ascension.
- Archaeostudies: archaeology, minor artifacts, archaeotechnologies (requires Ancient Relics DLC)

## Table usage

**Color indicators:** **Starter** , **Acquisition** , **Rare** , **Dangerous** , **Repeatable** .

**Notes:**

1. The table shows the default names/icons of techs. Flavor entry is displayed if accompanied by a change to effects/requirements.
2. If a tech was available as a research option as part of the last choice, then its (total) weight is **halved** in the coming choice.
3. The table denotes the base cost of a tech. Actual in-game tech cost scales with game settings and (number of colonized planets and population).
4. **To research techs of higher tiers, it is necessary to first acquire six or more techs of the preceding tier.**
5. Sorting the table by tiers places all **Starter** tech at the top and **Repeatable** end-game tech at the bottom.
6. Most icons also double as links. For more information about an unlocked effect (buildings, components, etc.), click on the accompanying icon.
