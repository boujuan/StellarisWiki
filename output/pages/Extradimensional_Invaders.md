# Extradimensional Invaders

The **Extradimensional Invaders** are one of the endgame crises . They are energy beings from another dimension who invade the galaxy with the intent of devouring the lifeforce of every species in it. The crisis begins with a note about a massive power surge somewhere in the galaxy.

Immediately, in a non-pulsar system outside the borders of a Fallen Empire, a Dimensional Portal, a portal starbase and the main Unbidden fleet will emerge. If the system lies within the borders of an empire, the starbase is instantly destroyed. 15 days later, a second fleet will emerge. Another 15 days later, a third fleet will emerge, contact with the Unbidden will open and the location of the Dimensional Portal will be added to the Situation Log. Fleets will destroy starbases in systems, turning them into unclaimed territory, while constructors will build starbases in unclaimed systems.

It should be noted that unlike the other crises, which provide warning several years in advance, the Extradimensional Invaders will arrive instantly and with no indication of where the portal will open.

As the Extradimensional Invaders consume more of the galaxy, a faint wind will be heard in the background.

## Mechanics

Extradimensional Invaders will focus their attacks on a single empire. If an empire’s ruler has the Chosen One trait, that will be the target. Otherwise, empires with a Psionic founder species will be targeted first.

If an Extradimensional fleet reaches an undefended planet, it will drain life from orbit. When Devastation reaches 100%, the planet is turned into a Barren World with the Terraforming Candidate modifier. Habitable megastructures will be destroyed and cannot be rebuilt. Extradimensional fleets ignore FTL Inhibitors .

The Dimensional Portal cannot be destroyed until all Dimensional Anchors are destroyed. These are located in systems highlighted in the Galaxy Map, improve shields hardening for Extradimensional fleets in the system by 50% and have perfect cloaking detection. The portal will remain guarded by the main Extradimensional fleet. If the portal system is attacked, then the invaders will recall all of their ships to aid in its defense. If the starbase in the portal system is destroyed, all fleets will remain to guard the system until it is rebuilt, halting their expansion. The empire that destroys the last Dimensional Portal will gain the Extradimensional Warlock Relic as well as a temporary Opinion bonus from everyone, and will be awarded the Rift Sealed achievement.

## Extradimensional reinforcements

The Extradimensional Invaders get additional fleets 55, 90, 180, 265, 340, 425 and 550 days after the portal spawns. Afterwards, unless they have more than 2000 ships, they will receive smaller reinforcement fleets through the portal at regular intervals, with the interval being lower if they have more starbases:

- 0 Starbases: 1500 days, ±200
- 1 Starbases: 1300 days, ±200
- 2 Starbases: 1100 days, 200
- 3 Starbases: 900 days, ±200
- 4 Starbases: 600 days, ±200
- 5 Starbases: 400 days, ±200
- 6 Starbases: 400 days, ±200
- 7 Starbases: 300 days, ±100
- 8 Starbases: 250 days, ±50
- 9 Starbases: 200 days, ±50
- 10+ Starbases: 150 days, ±50

## The Aberrant and the Vehement

When the Unbidden borders cover either 15% of the galaxy or 90 systems, a second extradimensional portal will open, bringing up another faction called the Aberrant. A few years later, a third portal bringing a third faction called the Vehement will open. While all three factions will be hostile towards everything, they are also hostile towards each other.

The new factions have a far shorter delay for the Initial Fleet spawns (1, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 150, 350) in order to bring them on even ground with the Unbidden.

## Extradimensional fleets

Unbidden, Aberrant and Vehement ships use different names and colors but are otherwise identical. All components can be reverse-engineered, including their unique weapons.

Initial fleets consist of 8 battleships, 12 cruisers and 20 escorts led by a commander that has a 50% chance to have the Dimensional Stutter or Ethereal trait.

Reinforcement fleets consist of 5 battleships, 8 cruisers and 15 escorts led by a commander that has a 50% chance to have the Dimensional Stutter or Ethereal trait.

Portal fleets consist of 20 battleships, 30 cruisers and 45 escorts led by a commander with the Ethereal trait.

## Successfully repelling the Extradimensional Invaders

Extradimensional ship health is about one third hull, two thirds shield with no armor, so using fleets with only kinetic weapons is very effective. Explosive weapons can also be very effective as the Invaders have lackluster point defense and no shield hardening except in systems with a Dimensional Anchor (which provides +50% hardening.) In terms of fleet composition, focus on Battleships with Giga Cannons and Kinetic Batteries, combined with Titans using the shield dampening aura. Alternative fleet compositions are Whirlwind Missile cruisers, Focused Arc Emitter battleships, or carriers (either cruisers or battleships). In terms of defense, the Invaders solely use energy weapons, so a focus on shield modules is ideal. Their weapons also have poor range, so increasing sublight speed can allow artillery ships to kite them from a safe distance.

Since Extradimensional Invader ships do not use any armor, luring fleets to fight in systems with Pulsar stars can be advantageous as it nullifies their shields while the player’s fleet can use armor. Cosmic Storms also disable all shields, providing a similar advantage to an armor using fleet and the Zroni Storm Caster can be used to create a storm in a system. Because these systems will also disable the player's shields however, and because Extradimensional Invader weapons still deal bonus damage to armor, the best case scenario is to fight the Unbidden after they have just left any system which nullifies shields. This allows the player to use shielded ships while the Invaders are still recharging their shields.

The player has multiple strategic choices when faced with these Extradimensional Invaders:

- A quick rush after the portal opening might be possible. However, one must be able to quickly dispatch the portal guards and initial fleets as they spawn, which requires very powerful fleets.
- Unlike other crises, their initial invasion fleets are much stronger than reinforcements. If the player can effectively clear their initial fleets, reinforcements shouldn't be a problem since they're much weaker than initial ones.
- Salvage should not be forgotten as it unlocks their unique weapons. The starbases are equally good sources of technology as the fleets while being much easier targets. However, the Matter Disintegrator weapons are anti-armor and hull, and the Extradimensionals use no armor on their ships, so replacing your weaponry with these is a bad idea to fight the invaders.
- If the Extradimensional Invaders have claimed many systems before normal empires can strike back, the player should focus on destroying their starbases and construction ships, since starbases will reduce reinforcement interval.

The arrival of the other Extradimensionals are a mixed blessing. On one hand, they might appear in the rear of a large empire or alliance, threatening important worlds and thus the defense against the existing Factions. On the other, all Extradimensional factions will begin to fight each other, potentially causing major damage to one another. Once engaged in combat there, the enemy fleets will have difficulty defending any of their starbases and even the portal itself, making this a crucial opening to strike at such critical targets.

## Formless interactions

If the Formless were not destroyed or vassalized at the end of their situation, they can be contacted while the Unbidden are present, offering some lore and advice on defeating them. The latter option costs 2000 Astral Threads and grants the "Secrets of the Unbidden" modifier, granting +10% damage against them. If the Aberrant and Vehement spawn, the Formless provide an identical damage buff for each of them as well, but the cost must be paid separately for each faction.

If the Extradimensional Invaders engage a fleet led by zagidal , a flavorful transmission will be sent where they react to his presence. Each Extradimensional faction has a separate reaction.
