# Unique systems

**Unique systems** can only spawn once per galaxy and are entirely predefined, as opposed to being randomly created. Each unique system has an unique event, anomaly or archaeology site related to it. They never appear in hyperlane choke points and a few of them require a certain distance from all empires to spawn and thus might not appear if the galaxy is started with a max number of fallen empires and AI empires, especially if advanced starts are used.

## Guaranteed systems

The following systems always appear in every game:

**Hauer**
: This class G system contains an unique object, the Tannhäuser Gate, guarded by three Ancient Mining Drones. If the Ancient Relics DLC is enabled, the planet Spjuuht contains the **Never Forget** archaeological site .
**Hillos**
: This system contains the Ghost Ship , an alien science ship marked as neutral. One of the planets is a Tundra World which contains a level III anomaly. Investigating it issues a special project that takes 360 days to research. Completing the special project grants a moderate amount of physics research.
**Klendath**
: This system contains two barren worlds and a moon and is defended by an Ancient Mining Drone. In addition, the planet Klendath I contains the **Crashed Starship** archaeological site .
**Orvall**
: Unlike every other system, Orvall not named after its central star. The system has a golden nebula visual effect regardless of whether it is spawned inside a nebula or not and is guarded by a small Tiyanki fleet. If the Ancient Relics DLC is enabled, the broken world Moor-Hsrettu contains the **Desiccated** archaeological site .
**Ubogleelt**
: This system is guarded by a ship of 2K fleet power and contains a broken world that has three notable moons: a size 5-7 Gaia world and two Barren worlds with the Terraforming Candidate planet modifier. The Gaia world also has the unique Nascent Locust planet modifier.
**Xraneax**
: This class G system contains Baloryz, a Tomb World guarded by a missiles-equipped destroyer and two asteroids with deposits of 5 minerals each. Defeating it grants a choice of gaining a small amount of engineering research or renaming the planet Lone Defender and gaining a moderate amount of unity (large amount if the empire is Memorialist). It also gives the Missile of the Lone Defender specimen if the Grand Archive DLC is installed.
**Omni**
: A randomly named system that contains a Relic World which contains the **Ruined World** archaeological site .
**Shielded Relic**
: A randomly named system that contains a size 30 Shielded World guarded by a fleet of 5k fleet power with ships identical to the ones guarding Zanaam. Surveying either the Shielded World or its moon reveals the **Moon Base** archaeological site .
**Kira**
: This class M system contains a size 20 Volcanic World with a level 3 anomaly. Investigating it will give the world the unique Hellish Oasis planet modifier.

### Wenkwort

Wenkwort contains a Gaia world called Wenkwort Artem with the unique Wenkwort Gardens planet modifier as well as a level IV anomaly. When the anomaly is investigated, it grants a very large amount of society research and issues a special project on a Barren world called Rellrait and creates three neutral Ancient Mining Drones that patrol the system. The special project adds a deposit of 3 society research to Rellrait and gives it the Terraforming Candidate planet modifier as well as a unique planet modifier granting it +3% Happiness and −15% Upkeep Upkeep from Jobs.

Wenkwort Artem has a unique planet modifier called Wenkwort Gardens. When the planet is first colonized, the player is contacted by a custodian robot and informed that industrialization of the planet is to be kept at a minimum. If the request is accepted, Wenkwort Artem gains a second planet modifier giving it the following effects:

- +40% Culture Worker output
- +20% Researcher output
- −30% Artisan output
- −70% Miner and Strategic Resource Gatherer output
- −70% Gas refiner output

Refusing causes a fleet of around 7K fleet power to arrive in 20 days and give one last chance to accept the modifier before attacking.

## Alpha Centauri

If Sol is chosen as a starting system for any generated empire, Alpha Centauri always spawn as a neighbor of Sol along with Barnard's Star, Procyon and Sirius. Alpha Centauri III always matches the climate preference of the founder species from Earth if guaranteed habitable worlds are enabled. Proxima Centauri b is a frozen world with the Tidal Locked planet modifier and a level I anomaly. Investigating the anomaly grants a small amount of unity and gives Proxima Centauri b the Terraforming Candidate planet modifier.

## Sol

If no starting empires have Sol as their home system, there is a 50% chance for it to spawn in the galaxy, inhabited by pre-FTL Humans. Unlike other pre-FTL civilizations, humans use regular flags and have additional armies. Earth can be found in one of five states:

| Age | Human ethics | Bonus armies | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Late Medieval Age | - Authoritarian<br>- Spiritualist<br>- Xenophobe | 3 primitive armies<br>  - Feudal Levies<br>  - Feudal Levies<br>  - Feudal Levies | |
| Machine Age | - Fanatic Militarist<br>- Materialist | 5 industrial armies<br>  - British Armed Forces<br>  - German Wehrmacht<br>  - Imperial Japanese Forces<br>  - Soviet Red Army<br>  - US Armed Forces | - Successfully invading this version of Earth unlocks the Outside Context achievement |
| Early Space Age | - Fanatic Egalitarian<br>- Xenophile | 5 postatomic armies<br>  - Chinese PLA<br>  - EU Combined Forces<br>  - Russian Armed Forces<br>  - US Armed Forces East<br>  - US Armed Forces West<br>- ISS II (space station) | - If they discover FTL, they become the United Nations of Earth |
| Nuclear Wasteland | No Species destroyed | None | - Earth is a Tomb World with a unique level I anomaly<br>- When investigated, the anomaly reveals a species of pre-sapient Cockroaches with the Tomb World climate preference and the Adaptive trait<br>- If the Underground Vault event chain starts on Earth, the created species is human<br>- If the Ancient Relics DLC is enabled, terraforming Earth will reveal the **Weapons Cache** archaeological site |

### Helios

There is a 5% chance for Sol to spawn as the Helios system. The celestial objects will use Greek instead of Roman names. The asteroids in the inner asteroid belt will be called Gravity Manipulation and have a deposit of 1 physics research each. Earth and the sun will trade places, with Earth being being a Tomb World renamed to Celestial Orrery Site and having a level V anomaly. Investigating it will add the Dark Matter Drawing technology as a permanent research option and bring the following options:

- Give Celestial Orrery Site the Celestial Orrery Supercomputer planetary feature and every Gravity Manipulation asteroid a deposit of +1 physics and +1 dark matter
- Gain 500 dark matter and a very large amount of physics research but the system is destroyed and the science ship and scientist are lost

## Randomly spawned systems

The following systems have their spawn chanced determined by the galaxy size. Systems that contain habitable worlds have their spawn chance affected by the Habitable Worlds setting while those that contain pre-FTL civilizations also have their spawn chance affected by the Pre-FTL Civilizations and Pre-Sapient Species setting. The Sol system is not affected by these settings. When both settings are at 1x, the percentages for each unique system to spawn are the following:

| Galaxy | Trappist | Odryskia | Polaris | Seddom | Parvus | Unknown Zanaam | Sanctuary | Unknown Shallash | Larionessi Refuge | Zevox | Unknown Ancient Manufactory | Ultima Vigilis | Federation's End |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tiny | 20% | 20% | 10% | 8% | 6% | 6% | 4% | 6% | 25% | 25% | 25% | 25% | 25% |
| Small | 40% | 40% | 20% | 16% | 12% | 12% | 8% | 12% | | | | | |
| Medium | 60% | 60% | 30% | 24% | 18% | 18% | 12% | 18% | | | | | |
| Large | 80% | 80% | 40% | 32% | 24% | 24% | 16% | 24% | | | | | |
| Huge | 100% | 100% | 50% | 40% | 30% | 30% | 20% | 30% | | | | | |

| Galaxy | Ruined ringworld | C.A.R.E. | Leviathans systems | Distant Stars systems | Cosmic Storms systems | Ruined megastructures | Star Mall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tiny | 6% | 16% | 16% for each system | 16% for each system | 6% for each system | 8% for each system | 6% |
| Small | 12% | 32% | 32% for each system | 32% for each system | 12% for each system | 16% for each system | 12% |
| Medium | 18% | 48% | 48% for each system | 48% for each system | 18% for each system | 24% for each system | 18% |
| Large | 24% | 64% | 64% for each system | 64% for each system | 24% for each system | 32% for each system | 24% |
| Huge | 30% | 80% | 80% for each system | 80% for each system | 30% for each system | 40% for each system | 30% |

### Trappist

Trappist is based on a real life system . In game, it contains one habitable planet and two planets with the Terraforming Candidate modifier. The features and possible modifiers of all planets are randomized.

| Planet | Trappist I | Trappist II | Trappist III | Trappist IV | Trappist V | Trappist VI | Trappist VII |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Class | Molten | Barren | Toxic | Barren (Terraforming Candidate) | Continental | Barren (Terraforming Candidate) | Frozen |
| Size | 16 | 16 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 12 |

### Odryskia

A randomly named system contains an asteroid called The Cabin. Surveying it reveals the **Debris Belt** archaeological site .

### Polaris

Polaris contains a size 23 Ocean World with the unique Ancient Sunken City planetary feature and the **One Last Hope** archaeological site . It is defended by a 3k molluscoid fleet named Polarian Automated Fleet . The fleet guarding it consists of seven cruisers named after ice formations. The fleet is hostile, however it is not set to aggressive stance, simply blocking any approach to the system's star. After they are defeated, the system can be claimed as usual. The cruisers use the following loadout:

| Weapons | Utility | Core |
|---|---|---|
| - 3 Missile T3<br>- 1 Plasma T2<br>- 3 Disruptor T3 | - 4 Armor T4<br>- 4 Shields T4 | - Hyper Drive III<br>- Advanced Combat Computer (Line)<br>- Plasma Thrusters<br>- Subspace Sensors<br>- Antimatter Reactor |

### Seddom

Seddom contains a star smaller than planets and a large extradimensional rift underneath it. The system contains only Shrouded worlds and has no resources aside from a small deposit of 1 Energy on the star. The first planet, Ariph, contains a level I anomaly. Investigating it will grant a moderate amount of Physics research, enlarge the star to natural size and terraform every Shrouded world into other uninhabitable planets and give every one of them a deposit. The system will gain the following resources in total: 14 Energy, 9 Minerals, 4 Alloys, 2 Exotic Gases and 2 Rare Crystals.

### Parvus

Parvus contains a size 22 Desert World with a level VI anomaly. Investigating it gives the planet a nanite swarm modifier that ensures 0% Habitability and Happiness if the planet is colonized as well as issues a special project. The special project requires 300 days to be completed and brings three options:

- Studying the swarm grants the Administrative AI technology. If already researched, it grants a moderate amount of physics research instead.
- Destroying the swarm requires a fleet of 2K fleet power to be brought in orbit of the planet, removes the modifier and gives the planet the Nanite Swarm Remains planetary feature.
- Taming the swarm requires the Self-Evolving Logic technology and starts another special project that requires 300 days. Finishing it clears all blockers from the planet, terraforms it into one that matches the founder species' climate preference and replaces the modifier with Tamed Nanite Swarm. If Void Dwellers, Shattered Ring or Machine species, the planet is terraformed into a Gaia World.

### Zanaam

A randomly named system contains Zanaam, a size 25 Gaia World with the unique Valley of Zanaam planetary feature and defended by an 19k fleet named Guardians of Zanaam . The fleet guarding it consists of 24 destroyers, named from Alpha to Omega, which look like Ancient Mining Drones but use far more advanced components. Upon entering the system, the player is given a message stating they will be destroyed. The fleet is hostile, however it is not set to aggressive stance, simply blocking any approach to the system's star. After they are defeated, the system can be claimed as usual. The destroyers use the following components:

| Weapons | Utility | Core |
|---|---|---|
| - 2 Laser T5<br>- 2 Plasma T3 | - 2 Armor T5<br>- 1 Shields T5 | - Sapient Combat Computer (Swarm)<br>- Impulse Thrusters<br>- Tachyon Sensors<br>- Zero Point Reactor |

### Sanctuary

Sanctuary contains an abandoned ring world of previous Enigmatic Observers. Originally created to act as a nature preserve and house primitive life, the system was abandoned but left guarded by multiple defense platforms of approximately 42k fleet power. Upon discovering the system, an empire is contacted by the automated defense facility, which explains the history and purpose of the facility and fires upon any ship that approaches it. However, the Sanctuary system is usually quite large (especially compared to other Ring World systems), and the range of the platforms is limited. With a little bit of micro-management, ships can easily be navigated through the system without entering combat.

The Sanctuary defenses contain the following stations:

| | 1 Sanctuary Core | 4 A-1 Fortresses | 11 A-2 Outposts |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weapons | - 10 Kinetic Artillery<br>- 10 Gauss Cannon<br>- 4 Point-Defense T3 | - 6 Laser T5<br>- 10 Laser T5<br>- 4 Plasma Cannon T3<br>- 4 Point-Defense T3 | - 2 Laser T5<br>- 5 Laser T5<br>- 2 Point-Defense T3 |
| Utility | - 10 Armor T5<br>- 10 Shield T5<br>- 4 Shield Capacitor | - 10 Armor T5<br>- 10 Shield T5<br>- 4 Shield Capacitor | - 3 Armor T5<br>- 3 Shield T5<br>- 2 Shield Capacitor |
| Core | - Zero Point Reactor<br>- Tachyon Sensors | - Zero Point Reactor<br>- Tachyon Sensors | - Zero Point Reactor<br>- Tachyon Sensors |

Despite having no engine modules, the stations are, in fact, mobile, and therefore cannot be engaged with artillery ships from a safe distance, one by one. Defeating them may prove a challenge but destroyed platforms are not rebuilt, allowing the system to slowly be overtaken.

The ring world is almost completely intact and each habitable segment houses a randomized pre-FTL species, none of them advanced beyond the Steam Age. Any empire that manages to defeat the platforms can lay claim to the extremely valuable system and decide the fate of the inhabiting species. It should be noted that since the species have evolved and reached sapience on the ring world they have Ring World Preference.

### Larionessi Refuge

Larionessi Refuge has deposits that total 5 physics, 11 Minerals and 4 alloys. It also contains a planet that is a Relic world if Ancient Relics is enabled and a Tropical world otherwise. The planet has the **The Signal** archaeology site .

### Zevox

Zevox has deposits that total 10 energy, 3 minerals, 4 alloys and 2 rare crystals. The barren moon called Zero-Two contains the **The Crashed Ship** archaeology site .

### Ancient Manufactory

A random system which contains an asteroid field where one of the large asteroids is orbited by an Ancient Manufactory identical to the Mining Drone stations. Surveying the asteroid reveals a level III anomaly. Investigating it gives the option to either:

- Leave the manufactory alone. Xenophobe and Fanatic Xenophobe empires gain 100 influence from this option.
- Start a Special Project to restore the manufactory with a fleet. Not available to Fanatic Xenophobe empires. Possible outcomes are granting the Rare Crystals Manufacturing technology or launching the manufactory into the star and awakening three hostile Ancient Mining Drones or Crystalline Entities. If the system has been claimed, another possible outcome is turning the manufactory into a mining station and adding a deposit of 10 minerals to the star.

### Ultima Vigilis

Ultima Vigilis is a system with an appearance similar to the Contingency core system. The system does not have any hyperlane connection so it can only be entered via jump drives or quantum catapults. It contains one deposit of each advanced resource and a unique AI world, called Observation Terminal, with the **Ancient Robot World** archaeology site . The system is guarded by three Fallen Empire fleets, each made up of one titan, five battlecruisers and 20 escorts.

After successfully investigating the archaeology site, five options are displayed. Unless the second option (which creates a Sentry array ) is chosen, there is a 50% chance for an internal global flag ( endgame_crisis_early_start ) to be set. This flag bypasses all of the checks for the endgame start date in the endgame crisis trigger code, which allows any endgame crisis (depending on your other actions) to be triggered prior to the endgame start date. The base chance is approximately >95% for any crisis to occur on a five-yearly pulse, which does not go down after the defeat of the first crisis. The only reductive modifier to this chance is whether a War in Heaven has the ability to spawn later onwards in the endgame, which thus prevents every crisis from the Unbidden from spawning and gives it an 80% chance of spawning on each five-yearly pulse. See Crisis for more details.

### Shallash

This system can only spawn bordering the Xenophobic Isolationists and contains a Tomb World, also named Shallash, orbited by six equidistant moons that contains the **Ruined Star System** archaeology site . The system also contains multiple minerals deposits. It is patrolled by a Xenophobic Isolationists battlecruiser.

### Federation's End

A black hole system that contains two habitats with the Arcane Replicator planetary feature. Each habitat is inhabited by a pre-FTL civilization in the Atomic Age with the Void Dwellers origin.

### Star Mall

A random class G system in the galaxy which contains an avian Habitat and multiple asteroids holding billboards. The habitat has the unique Promenade planetary feature and Star Mall modifier. All district slots as well as the Promenade are initially blocked by blockers that require energy and minerals to remove.

If the Grand Archive DLC is also installed then any empire entering the system will receive the Star Mall Complimentary Map specimen.

### Ruined ringworld

A random system in the galaxy which contains a ruined ringworld. As with all ruined megastructures, the ringworld can be repaired if the empire has the Mega-Engineering technology.

If the Distant Stars DLC is also enabled, the star has a 50% chance to contain a unique level VI anomaly. Investigating it adds a deposit of +3 physics to the star. If the empire is Fanatic Purifiers or Determined Exterminator, it gains 125-250 Influence and 100-500 unity. Otherwise, investigating the anomaly brings the option to either:

- Issue a special project to thaw the clones. The project takes 30 days to complete and creates on a random world two Pops of a species with the Proles, Strong, Nerve Stapled and Tomb World climate preference traits. If the empire has the Devouring Swarm civic, it instead gains 350-2000 food and 100-500 unity.
- Leave the clones in stasis and add a deposit of +4 society research to the star. If a ringworld segment is repaired and colonized, the empire gets the option to either instantly thaw the clones and create on the colonized segment two Pops of a species with the Proles, Strong, Nerve Stapled and Tomb World climate preference traits or leave the clones in stasis and add the Cryonic Clones Monument planetary feature to the colonized segment.

### C.A.R.E.

A random binary system in the galaxy that contains a Relic World. Surveying it reveals the **Planetary Machinery** archaeological site .

Finishing the excavation opens a dialogue window with C.A.R.E. Interactive Interface. Agreeing to help it issues the Develop A Cure For The Ferrophage Special Project. Finishing the project takes 10 years and grants the The Defragmentor Defragmentor relic while the Relic World gains a permanent +10% Energy from Jobs modifier. Refusing grants 100 Influence instead.

### Distant Stars systems

#### Junk Ratlings

These are three connected systems: a randomly named pulsar system that contains a Tomb World planet called Ruinous Core orbited by a Tomb World moon called Lost Encampment, as well as various debris throughout the system. A second system contains three Tomb Worlds: Silent Colony, Decayed Hub and Crumbling Borough. A third system contains a Tomb World called Fallen Outpost. The player is notified upon entering any of these systems for the first time. Surveying Ruinous Core reveals a level II anomaly. Investigating it grants a significant amount of society research.

25 to 35 years after the first system was entered, a species called Ketling emerges on each Tomb World as long as the system is not owned by an empire. A special project is added to investigate any Tomb World in one of these systems and doing so grants a large amount of society research.

Planets with Ketlings cannot be colonized but can be invaded. If invaded, they suffer Culture Shock identically to invading a pre-FTL civilization.

Another 25 to 35 years after the Ketling emerge, they become the Ketling Star Pack . All their planets are filled with buildings, and they gain a fleet of two cruisers, four destroyers and five corvettes. If these systems are owned by an empire, they have a temporary −50 opinion towards the systems owner.

The exact delay of both the species emergence and the empire creation are set at the moment the preceding event occurs, so reloading a save prior to their appearance cannot change the delay unless the save is from before the event.

Terraforming all six Tomb Worlds into Gaia Worlds as an empire with an

civic awards the Fixer Upper achievement.

#### Sea of Consciousness

A random binary star system that contains a size 24 Ocean World with a unique appearance and other uninhabitable planets. The planet has no blockers and has a Betharian Fields planetary feature. It also has the unique Sea of Consciousness planet modifier, which is removed if the planet is terraformed into anything except a Continental, Tropical, or Gaia World.

Surveying the planet reveals a level V anomaly. Investigating it does not grant anything to a Gestalt Consciousness empire but grants other empires a moderate amount of society research and issues a special project that requires owning the system. Within half a year after the special project is completed, a scientist requests to leave for the planet. There are three options:

1. Allow the scientist to leave. One year later, the empire gains a Psionics technoligy.
2. Forbid the scientist to leave. Three months later, the scientist dies. 10 years later, the empire gains a Psionics technology.
3. Remove the scientist, ending the event chain.

The Psionics technology received the first of the fellowing technologies that is not already researched:

1. **Psionic Theory** technology
2. **Telepathy** technology
3. **Precognition Interface** technology

If all technologies are researched, the empire instead gains a large amount of physics and society research.

#### Twin Tomb World Civilizations

This star system contains two Tomb Worlds, both with humanoid Bronze Age civilizations with the Post-Apocalyptic origin. Surveying the second Tomb World reveals a level III anomaly. Investigating it grants a moderate amount of society research. The species are always the following:

| **Czyrni** | **Pyorun** |
|---|---|
| - Survivor<br>- Charismatic<br>- Quarrelsome<br>- Intelligent<br>- Talented<br>- Solitary | - Survivor<br>- Charismatic<br>- Quarrelsome<br>- Resilient<br>- Strong |

#### Gish

A class B star system that can only appear if the game difficulty is higher than Civilian and the game was started with at least one AI empire. It contains a Shielded World typically called Gish showing a desert planet underneath, although the name may vary. Surveying it reveals a level IV anomaly. Investigating it brings the option to either:

- Repair the shield with a science ship to add an 8 physics and 4 society deposit to the world for a few decades.
- Interrupt the time loop with a science ship, gaining a small amount of physics research. There is a 50% chance of the world turning into a tomb world and a 50% chance of creating the Prikkiki-Ti empire.
- Leave the planet alone and gain 150 each of physics and society research. Around a decade later, if the system is not owned by an empire, the Prikkiki-Ti empire emerges.

#### Paridayda

This system can only be found through the Ancient Hulk anomaly by choosing the option to search for the planet. This starts a special project. Finishing it creates a neighboring system and points to a Barren World inside. Choosing to investigate further when entering the system starts a special project to investigate the planet with a science ship. Finishing the special project takes 60 days and reveals the planet as a size 25 Gaia World with the Stone Age Mardak Vol civilization and the unique Paridayda planet modifier.

A few days after the system becomes owned, a species called the Vol arrive with a fleet to purge the Mardak Vol. Accepting destroys the civilization and adds a removable blocker to the planet. Refusing causes the fleet attack the system. If their fleet is not defeated, they bombard the planet with the Armageddon stance. Once all Mardak Vol pops are killed by bombardment, the planet gains four removable blockers.

Accepting is the recommended course of action – as not only does it avoid the fight, but the Mardak Vol would take a long time to enlighten or remove Stellar Culture Shock and have the Gaia World climate preference. In addition, if the planet is colonized, the colonists gain +10% Happiness for 10 years.

#### Other systems

**Abandoned Observation Post**
: This class F star system contains an Abandoned Observation Post orbiting a habitable planet. Surveying the planet reveals a level IV anomaly. Investigating it brings the option to either: Investigate the observation post with a science ship to gain a moderate amount of society research. Leave the observation post alone and gain 50 influence.

**Abandoned Star Platform**
: This system contains an Abandoned Star Platform orbiting a pulsar star. Surveying the star reveals a level IV anomaly. Investigating it brings the option to start a 60 days special project to either: Repair the platform with a construction ship to add a 6 energy deposit to the pulsar. Salvage the platform with a science ship to gain 20% to the next level of lasers technology.

**Caretaker Escape Pod**
: This binary star system has as its last planet a Gas Giant with escape pods in orbit. Surveying the planet reveals a level III anomaly. Investigating it brings the option to either ignore the pod for a small amount of influence or hail it and get the following options: Valid if AI is not outlawed: Accept Caretaker AX7-b , gaining a renowned paragon. If the empire is individualist, Caretaker AX7-b has the Caretaker destiny trait. If the empire is Gestalt Consciousness, the Growth Node gains the Caretaker Teachings destiny trait. Valid if AI is not outlawed: Examine Caretaker AX7-b for a moderate amount of engineering research. Valid if AI is outlawed: Destroy the pod for a small amount of influence. Valid if Machine Intelligence: Recycle Caretaker AX7-b for a small amount of minerals and engineering research.

**Gaia Civilization**
: This class M star system contains a Gaia moon orbited by a derelict station. Surveying the moon reveals a Stone Age civilization with the Extremely Adaptive, Slow Breeders, Sedentary and Gaia World climate preference traits, as well as a level VI anomaly. Investigating it grants a significant amount of physics and society research. This system cannot spawn if primitives have been disabled.
**Rudimentary Robots**
: This star system contains a single habitable planet with the Metal Boneyards planetary feature among other uninhabitable planets. Surveying the planet reveals a level I anomaly. Investigating it adds three or four robot Pops to the planet. After the planet is colonized, there is the option to either: Dismantle the robot Pops and gain 100 minerals. Keep using the robots. 90 days later a special project to investigate the robots with a science ship is given. Finishing the special project takes 30 days and gives a large amount of society research.
: Regardless of the chosen option, around five years after the planet has been colonized a number of colonists gain the Erratic Behavior modifier, giving −25% to Happiness, Governing Ethics Attraction and Resource Production, and a special project to investigate it is added, costing 60 society research. Finishing the research project grants a random Biology technology. If the special project is not completed within four months, three enraged colonists armies form and attempt to occupy the planet.
**Superflares**
: This class G star system contains a number of uninhabitable planets and a gas giant with multiple moons, one of them being a Tomb World with the unique Irradiated Valley planetary feature. Another one of the planets is a frozen world with a level I anomaly. Investigating it adds a 4 society deposit to the world. The star also has a 3 physics deposit. A year after the planet is colonized, a special project is added to shield the colony with a science ship. The project takes 30 days to complete and gives the planet a +10 Unity from Jobs modifier. The scientist also gains the Expertise: Field Manipulation trait. If the project is not started in 150 days, one pop dies and the planet gains −10% habitability and −15% Energy from Jobs for 20 years.
**The Veil**
: This binary star system contains a planet that appears as either a Gaia World or a Shrouded World. Surveying it reveals the Phase-Shifted planet modifier ( −50% Planet Build Speed) and the only level X anomaly besides certain precursor anomalies in the game. Investigating it describes how every three months the planet shifts between a Gaia World and a Shrouded World and grant a moderate amount of physics. Once the system is owned, there is the option to either: Leave the planet be and gain a moderate amount of influence. Start a special project to use a science ship to freeze the phase-shift. The project takes 180 days and finishing it permanently sets the planet to a Gaia World. It also grant a moderate amount of physics research.

The event is currently bugged, either not giving the tier X anomaly, giving the special project before the anomaly is done and more, all leading to The Veil not phase-locking. As a workaround, make sure NOT to own the system when the anomaly research is finished. Once you build (or rebuild) an outpost in that system, the special project appears and work correctly.

### Cosmic Storms systems

All planets from the DLC are above regular size and have a unique appearance and planet modifier. The appearance is lost if the planet is terraformed.

- A class G system will contain a Desert World with the Metal Planet modifier
- A class G system will contain a single Tropical World with the Arboreal World modifier
- A random system will contain a single Continental World in an unique asteroid belt with the Previously Terraformed Planet modifier

#### Collided planet

A random class M system in the galaxy contains a massive size 25-30 Continental World orbited by 3 asteroids. The planet has a double number of blockers and the Collided Planet modifier.

A year after the planet is colonized, the empire will receive a moderate amount of Society Research. Half a year later, it will receive a moderate amount of Engineering Research. Another half a year later, the empire will be warned that the planet will be destroyed in 50 years and offer two optional special projects to prevent it. Both special projects cost 5000 Society Research.

- The **Stabilize the Collision** special project has a 5% chance to terraform the planet into a Gaia World and a 95% chance to give the option to leave the world as a Continental World or terraform it into an Alpine World or Savannah World
- The **Harmonize the Collision** special project has a 33% chance to terraform the planet into a Gaia World, a 63% chance to give it 4 Active Volcano and Impact Crater blockers and 4% chance to destroy it but grant a massive amount of Society Research.
- If the special projects are refused or neither is completed, in 50 years the planet is destroyed.

### Privateers

This system cannot appear if the Apocalypse DLC is enabled, as the Privateers are replaced by the Marauders .

A random system in the galaxy is home to the Privateers, a group of three pirate fleets which must be defeated:

- Young Blood contains 12 corvettes and uses tier I components
- Scarred Veterans contains four corvettes, 16 destroyers and 20 cruisers, and uses tier II components
- Old Guard contains a battleship and uses tier III components

All fleets are balanced but have a slight bias towards armor components, making fleets with a slight bias towards energy weapons the counter. Defeating the privateers will give 2500 Minerals, 1500 Energy and 750 Alloys. If an L-gate has been discovered, the empire will also receive an L-Gate Insight. The system's only resources are two asteroids with slightly better Minerals deposits.

## Scion of Vagros systems

Scion of Vagros are a group of five unique systems that has a 25% chance to spawn each game. They can be exploited by any empire in any order but only the first empire that enters the Dugar system can gain the full benefits.

The Dugar system when first entered brings the option to start a special project on the planet Dugar IV. The special project requires 360 days and completing it starts a second special project on the empire capital. The second special project requires 180 days and completing it grants the Relic Fragment relic and empires that are not Gestalt Consciousness or genocidal have the option to gain the legendary paragon Keides, Scion of Vagros in 20 years. Empires with the Evolutionary Predators origin can also choose to gain Mammalian DNA and progress for the Adaptive Evolution situation instead of the paragon.

The Ivusheh system contains a Desert World with the unique Ship Junkyard modifier and one Fallen Shipyard and six Crashed Ships planetary features.

The Taprib system contains a Tropical World with the unique Hostile Planet modifier and one Aggressive Wildlife and three Aggressive Flora planetary features.

The Vapob system contains an Alpine World with the unique Molten Mineral Rivers modifier and three Volcanic Activity planetary features.

The final system, Sursect, only appears after an empire completes the event chain and is mainly accessible through a wormhole. It contains a Relic world with the unique Pulsar Flares modifier, one Scarred Land and two Ancient Facilities planetary features and the Vagrosian Ruins archaeological site which can only be excavated by Keides, Scion of Vagros. The system is protected by a fleet of 72 ships identical to the Guardians of Zanaam. The fleet can be defeated either directly, by completing a special project that requires 6000 engineering research or by surrendering the The Key relic.

## Treasure Hunters systems

Empires with the Treasure Hunters origin generate 5 systems throughout their story.

The first system is guarded by a fleet of 1 pirate destroyer and 8 pirate corvettes, which retreats after it loses half of the ships. It contains a Shattered World called Soropegma with a deposit of 4-6 Minerals. Another planet contains an archaeology site that is only revealed after the third system is surveyed. If the origin empire surveys Soropegma, it receives a special project that requires a construction ship and 180 days. Completing it grants the following rewards:

- One of the following specimens: Ytterite Kaleidoscopic Fascinator, Ytterite Preserved Corpse or Ytterite Royal Scepter
- 100-1000 Minerals
- +10 Minor Artifacts if Ancient Relics is enabled
- +250-100000 Society Research if Ancient Relics is not enabled
- −50% Cost to pursue the Grand Archive unless the empire obtained a specimen before
- Special project that costs 1000 Physics to upgrade the Celestial Chart relic and reveal the second system

The second system contains a Tundra World with the Hidden Black Needle Base planetary feature that cannot be colonized. If the origin empire surveys it, the empire receives 3 mutually-exclusive special projects:

- Hacking the Pirates requires a science ship and takes 540 days. When the special project is completed the science ship Scientist gains 800 experience but there is a 0-50% chance for them to die depending on their level.
- Assault the Black Needle Base requires at least 4 armies and takes 135 days. If the armies are led by a Commander, the commander receives 300 experience, otherwise the Minister of Defense receives it, if there is one. The empire also receives a scaled amount of Unity and the Black Needle Ceremonial Sword specimen. This special project is not available to Pacifist empires.
- Bombard the Black Needle Base requires a fleet with at least 2000 Fleet Power and takes 90 days. It results in a fleet of 4 pirate destroyers and 20 pirate corvettes attacking. If the fleet is led by a Commander, the commander receives 300 experience, otherwise the Minister of Defense receives it, if there is one. The empire also receives a scaled amount of Unity and the Black Needle Ceremonial Sword specimen. This special project is not available to Pacifist empires.

All special projects allow colonizing the planet and issue a second special project that costs 2000 Physics. Completing it upgrades the Celestial Chart relic and gives a random Materials technology.

The third system contains a Savannah World with the Hive Mind Dwelling planetary feature. If the origin empire surveys it, the empire reveals the Derelict Safehouse archaeological site in the first system.

Once the Celestial Chart relic is fully upgraded, the empire gains a scaled amount of Unity and reveals the fourth system. The system contains an inactive gateway protected by a fleet of 1 Voidworm Troika, 9 Voidworm Juveniles and 15 Voidworm Nymphs. Defeating the Voidworms unlocks the Gateway Activation technology if not already unlocked. Reactivating the gateway grants a scaled amount of Unity and reveals the final system.

The final system has no hyperlane connections and can only be accessed via gateways. It is guarded by a fleet of 1 pirate battleship and 60 cruisers. When first entered the pirates offer a deal to surrender the relic in exchange for the pirate battleship and Energy equal to half of the empire's storage capacity. If the deal is accepted the pirate fleet leaves. If the deal is refused, the pirate fleet becomes hostile, the Black Needle Saboteurs situation starts, and a fleet of 1 pirate battleship and 12 pirate corvettes attack the empire capital system. If the pirate fleet is defeated, the situation ends. If the origin empire defeated the fleet, it gains the Black Needle Ledger specimen, but it also receives +50% Piracy for 10 years unless a Gestalt Consciousness. Regardless of which empire defeated the fleet, the origin empire receives a special project to gain a choice between three rewards:

- 700-30000 Energy, Exotic Gases, Rare Crystals, Volatile Motes and Exotic Gases, Perikan Tapico Jewel specimen and Robe of the Golden Broker specimen. If Ancient Relics is enabled, it also gains 250-5000 Minor Artifacts.
- 250-5000 Energy, Exotic Gases, Rare Crystals, Volatile Motes and Exotic Gases, 700-2000000 Unity, Perikan Tapico Jewel specimen, 1 Favor from every empire and a temporary 100 Opinion with every empire not at war with. Empires with the Barbaric Despoilers or Letters of Marque civics cannot take this option.
- 700-2000000 Unity, 2 Favors from every empire, a temporary 200 Opinion with every empire not at war with it, and for 50 years the empire gains +2 Influence monthly and +40% Diplomatic Weight. Empires with the Barbaric Despoilers or Letters of Marque civics cannot take this option.

One month after the final choice, the empire gains the Body of Captain Ness specimen and the option to recruit the Captain Ness legendary paragon.

## Helito

The spawn chance of the Helito system is equal to the Pre-FTL Civilizations and Pre-Sapient Species setting, being 100% when the setting is 1x or higher. It is a binary system that contains a level VII anomaly on one of its stars. Investigating it grants a large amount of physics research and the option to reveal a new adjacent system called Dacha.

Dacha contains six Gaia worlds and entering it grants a moderate amount of physics research. Each planet is colonized by a unique Early Space Age pre-FTL civilization called Habinte Unified Worlds. If an Observation Post is constructed, an event immediately fires giving full awareness and establishing contact with Habinte Unified Worlds. Five years after establishing first contact, they ask the empire to leave the system. If the offer is accepted, the empire capital system gains a size 25 Gaia world, but all Observation Posts in Dacha are dismantled and new ones cannot be constructed.

If the offer is refused, a weaponised ship enters the system and the Outpost is upgraded to a Starbase ; if the empire attempts to invade or destroy any Habinte world before this event, all invading armies are destroyed, all ships in the system go MIA and the hyperlane leading to the system is removed. If the system is entered again via alternative means, hyperlane connections are created with a nearby system and the pre-FTL civilization immediately becomes a unique empire with all technologies of the empire that invaded, a fleet that uses 70% Naval Capacity, and a decaying −1000 Opinion towards the empire that invaded.

## Ithome cluster

The Ithome cluster has a 25% chance to spawn each game unless the game difficulty is set to Civilian or the game was started without AI empires. It does not have a hyperlane connection to the rest of the galaxy, but instead is connected to it via a wormhole. The cluster is controlled by a Fanatic Purifiers empire named "The Chosen" that has greatly increased chance to discover the Wormhole Stabilization technology after mid-game year. If an empire enters the cluster before that happens, the Chosen instantly declare war on them.

The system connecting the Ithome cluster to the rest of the galaxy, called Ithome's Gate, contains a deposit of 2 dark matter and three habitats. All habitats are size 3 and have an advanced resource planetary feature and a modifier giving it max habitability and building slots. The system at the heart of the cluster, called Aspharelle, contains three Gaia Worlds of size 30, 25 and 18. A nearby system called Taremes contains a very large amount of energy, minerals, rare crystals and volatile motes deposits.

Beyond the cluster, there is a disconnected system called Ophala which can only be entered via jump drives. The system contains a size 25 Gaia World with a Stone Age pre-FTL civilization of the same species as the cluster's empire and the **Abandoned Observation Post** archaeological site .
