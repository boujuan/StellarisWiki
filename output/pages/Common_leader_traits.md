### Luminary

The starting ruler of empires that have the Under One Rule origin has the Luminary trait. They can also gain the Paranoid Tyrant trait through events and can remove it by giving in to the Reformists' demands at the end of the Reformists Demands situation.

They will stop growing if the ruler is changed at any point during the story.
