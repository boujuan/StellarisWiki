# Environmental effects

**Environmental effects** impart certain effects on ships and starbases and come primarily from the following:

- Certain types of stars
- Nebulae
- Cosmic storms (requires the Cosmic Storms DLC)

## Stars

A star is a celestial object that composes the center of a star system and influences the generation of the solar system. They are classified based on their spectral characteristics . Less common stars also have a negative effect on all ships in the system, making certain tactics less effective in battle. Different stars have different likelihoods for habitable planets to appear in the system.

Most solar systems are unary systems with only one star, but they can also exist as binary systems with two stars or trinary systems with three stars, either orbiting each other in the center with all planets around them or spread out further apart from each with a few planets orbiting each star. Star effects stack in binary and trinary systems. All binary and trinary systems except for F/M, B/M, B/neutron and A/neutron (which cannot spawn habitable planets) have 100% habitable planet chance. All natural systems have 4-10 (inclusive) orbiting objects, except single neutron stars, black holes and pulsars (which have 1-4).

| Type | Potential resources | Habitable planet chance | Effects | Possible megastructures |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Class B** The large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them among the most visible to the naked eye. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 40% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class A** These relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 40% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class F** F-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarves. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 100% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class G** Often referred to as yellow dwarves, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 100% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class K** These main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarves, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 100% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class M** The most common stars in the universe, often referred to as red dwarves. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarves emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 30% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class M Red Giant** With a large radius and comparatively low surface temperature, red giants are stars of moderate mass in a late stage of stellar evolution. Their expanded stellar atmosphere and high luminosity make for distant habitable zone orbits. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 7.5% | | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Class T Brown Dwarf** Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that lack the mass to sustain hydrogen fusion. Roughly the size of large gas giants, they have a much greater density. Their low luminosity and comparatively small heat generation means that planets orbiting them are unlikely to support life. | - Energy<br>- Physics | 30% | Can only appear in binary and trinary systems | |
| **Neutron Star** These incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star. The gravitational waves and radiation emitted by Neutron Stars must be carefully navigated around, slowing the sublight speed of ships. | - Engineering<br>- Physics | 0% | - 50% Sublight Speed Reduction<br>- Allows construction of a Quantum Catapult | - Ring World<br>- Quantum Catapult |
| **Pulsar** Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy. The radiation emitted by pulsars interferes with deflector technology, rendering ship and station shields inoperable. | - Engineering<br>- Physics | 0% | - 100% Shield Nullification<br>- Allows construction of a Quantum Catapult | - Ring World<br>- Quantum Catapult |
| **Black Hole** Typically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed. The gravitational waves emitted by black holes interfere with FTL drives, making it harder for ships to escape from combat. | - Engineering<br>- Physics<br>- Dark Matter | 0% | - 50% Disengagement Chance Reduction<br>- +50% Emergency FTL Jump Cooldown<br>- Unlocks the Black Hole Observatory starbase building<br>- Allows construction of a Matter Decompressor<br>- No Cannot have gas giants in orbit | Matter Decompressor |
| **Viridescent Lightbringer** Millennia of exposure to the Toxic Entity have caused alterations in the makeup of this star. Though once it was a fairly standard G-type star, now it emits an eerie green haze unlike anything seen elsewhere in the galaxy. | - Volatile Motes<br>- Exotic Gases | 0% | - 100% Armor Nullification<br>- Unique to the system created at the completion of the Quest for the Toxic God situation | - Dyson Sphere<br>- Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard<br>- Dyson Swarm |
| **Astral Star** In place of a star, the celestial objects in this system orbit an ancient Astral Rift. | Astral Threads | 0% | Unique to the azilash system . | - Ring World<br>- Mega Shipyard |

## Nebulae

Nebulae are visible from both the galaxy map and the systems located inside and tend to have fewer habitable planets within them, but the chance of finding Strategic Resources is increased by 50% and allow Starbases to construct the Nebula Refinery building. Nebulae block all sensor coverage originating from other systems, meaning that it is impossible for an empire to see what is within and beyond a nebula's hyperlanes without having a ship or starbase inside or owning a full Sentry Array. Nebulae are named and visible on the galaxy map from the start of the game.

Systems within a nebula have a small chance of being ionized, visible by occasional lightning strikes within the system. Such systems disable shields and apply −50% sublight speed but grant +30% evasion.

Nebulae also give +3 Cloaking Strength to any ship with a cloaking device.

Nebulae have a triple chance of containing Astral Scars.

## Cosmic storms

This section describes the cosmic storms game mechanic. For the DLC, see Cosmic Storms (DLC)

There are 8 types of cosmic storms that create a variety of effects on planets, ships, and sensors. Cosmic storm settings can be adjusted in the game settings. These include when and how often cosmic storms spawn, how many cosmic storms can exist simultaneously, how much time elapses between cosmic storms, and whether they will cause Devastation and how much. Cosmic storms may also be created by science ships if an empire has the Galactic Weather Control Ascension perk. Additionally cosmic storms may begin by a situation or event from the Storm Chasers origin.

Cosmic storms will appear on both the galaxy map and system map. Cosmic storms will block outside sensors and an empire will require a ship, starbase, or full Sentry Array to see what is within and beyond a cosmic storm's hyperlanes. A cosmic storm will appear and move affecting all systems along the way. Up to 12 systems can be affected simultaneously. Cosmic storms do not spawn or travel next to other storms unless there's no other system available. The size of a cosmic storm scales with the galaxy size.

The Weather Forecast map mode will highlight all systems affected by cosmic storms. Researching the Cosmic Weather Models technology will forecast cosmic storms up to a year in advance. If the Probability Current technology is also researched then the forecast will be more accurate and show the cosmic storms' forecasted path.

When a cosmic storm enters an owned system there is a 10% chance of receiving a small amount of Physics research and a special project. Completing the special project will reward resources depending on the cosmic storm type and unlock the Storm Dampening Generators technology for research if not already unlocked. This can only happen once.

All storms inflict +60% Emergency FTL Damage Risk in addition to the effects listed in the table below. The negative effects on planets can be reduced by constructing and upgrading a Storm Relief Center building. The Storm Relief Center building will also provide basic resources from jobs during a cosmic storm.The negative effects on ships can be reduced by researching certain technologies. Cosmic storms also increase the output of Astrometeorologist jobs.

When a cosmic storm ends every affected planet receives a planet modifier for 3 years and may receive planetary features (6.6% probability). Planetary blockers may be modified. New anomalies and archaeological sites may appear. If the cosmic storm ends within the borders of an empire that empire will unlock the Planetary Storm Negation technology as a permanent research option.

| **Note** 1. Shroud Storm is 10 times less likely to spawn than other storm types unless an empire breached the Shroud, and are 75% less likely to spawn in systems with Shroud Seals . | | | | | | | |

#### Nexus Storms

Nexus Storms are a far more devastating type of cosmic storm that are 20 times less likely to spawn than other storms and can only spawn after the mid-game year is reached. It causes 5 times more Devastation to planets than other cosmic storms and instead of +60% , it increases Emergency FTL damage risk by +100% . The storm disables Health Hull, Armor Armor and Shield Shield regeneration and causes 60 Monthly Damage to ships that have above 20% health.

When a Nexus Storm passes, the planets will receive one of the aftermaths of other cosmic storms at maximum severity.

Completing the cosmic storm special project on a Nexus Storm gives the combined resources of all other storm types: 350-10000 Energy, 350-10000 Minerals, 250-5000 Alloys and 250-5000 Zro.
