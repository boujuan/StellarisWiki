# Government

Every empire has a **government** that provides different benefits and positions for leaders. The name of a government is automatically determined according to its ethics , authority , civics and origin . The government can be reformed once every 20 years at the cost of 10 Unity per each point of Empire Size.

## Authority

An empire's authority decides how the ruler is selected, what their effects are, and what other bonuses the empire receives.

### Individualist authorities

The rulers of non-gestalt empires are changed through elections, which are held over a number of years or when the current ruler dies, except in Imperial empires, where the heir becomes the new ruler. These authorities can be changed by reforming the government unless the empire has the Under One Rule origin.

The Machine Age DLC is required to select non-gestalt authorities as a Machine species.

### Gestalt authorities

Gestalt authorities can only be selected by Gestalt Consciousness empires. They do not hold elections, their ruler and council nodes are immortal, and their authority type cannot be changed once the game starts.

| Authority | Empire effects | Ruler effects per skill level | Requirements | DLC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Machine Intelligence** Machine Intelligences are immense artificial group minds that have been networked into a single conscious entity. Most of the actual "population" in such an empire consists of mindless work units who perform their designated tasks without any semblance of free will. A small number of semi-autonomous agents are typically employed for more specialized tasks that benefit from some degree of independent initiative. | - +1 Nexus District when colonizing a world<br>- +1 Monthly mechanical pop assembly<br>- +10% Mining station output<br>- +25% Colony development speed<br>- Ruler has the Machine Intelligence trait | - −3% Empire size from pops | Machine species | - ( Shroud-Forged only) |
| **Hive Mind** Hive Minds operate as a single organism more than as a state. The population has no free will, and act as an extension of the Hive Mind itself - much like the limbs of a body. When cut off from the Mind, these drones become comatose and eventually wither and die. Any free individuals on planets owned by the Mind are driven away, killed, or simply treated as prey to feed the collective. | - −25% Empire size effect<br>- +25% Pop growth speed<br>- Pops have the Hive-Minded trait<br>- Ruler has the Hive Mind trait | - +2% Monthly unity | - No Wilderness origin<br>- No Machine species | |

They consist of symbiotic species drawn from a variety of biota, all acting in accordance with the collective will of their environment. Select symbionts may work semi-autonomously on specialized tasks, but most depend on regular contact with their mutualistic environment. If isolated, they will revert to wild and instinctive behavior before eventually perishing. | - −25% Empire size effect<br>- +200% Empire size from districts<br>- +200% Empire size from planets<br>- +100% Diplomatic weight from economy<br>- Pops have the Hive-Minded trait<br>- Ruler has the Hive Mind trait | - +2% Monthly unity | Wilderness origin | |

Empires that completed an ascension situation will have the option to replace their authority with an ascension authority. All ascension authorities will inherit the ruler effects and election mechanics from its parent authority, with exception for some ascension Imperial authorities, which have different ruler effects . The initial authority will match the parent authority but the empire can switch between authorities within the same set by reforming government. Subject empires will also unlock ascension authorities if their overlord does.

## Elections

Elections come in two kinds: democratic and oligarchic. Dictatorial authorities also have elections, which are identical to oligarchic ones except that the winner rules until death. Imperial authorities have no elections. The election cycle lasts 3 months and all empire leaders take part. The current ruler stays in office until the replacement is decided (if applicable). The cost of influencing elections is reduced by −75% by the Shadow Council civic.

- In oligarchic elections, a random leader is chosen as the next ruler. The empire can pay an amount of Unity determined by empire size to choose the winner.
- In democratic elections, each leader has a Support value which is equal to the power of the faction that shares its ethic. The leader with the highest Support becomes the next ruler. Support is affected in the following ways:
 - +20% if the empire is Fanatic Xenophile and the leader is not from the founder species or the current ruler
 - +20% if the leader class is favored by the government type
 - +20% if the leader has a veteran class focused on the council
 - +10% if the leader is the current ruler
 - +5% if the leader is already part of the empire council
 - +5% per councilor trait
 - +2% per skill level
 - −20% if the leader has a veteran class not focused on the council
 - −50% if the leader's guaranteed lifespan is passed
 - −50% if the empire is not any degree of Xenophobe or Xenophile and the leader is not from the founder species
 - Does not apply to leaders from the same species class if empire has the Selective Kinship civic

 - −90% if the empire is Xenophobe and the leader is not from the founder species
 - Does not apply to leaders from the same species class if empire has the Selective Kinship civic

 - −99% if the empire is Fanatic Xenophobe and the leader is not from the founder species
 - Does not apply to leaders from the same species class if empire has the Selective Kinship civic

 - The empire can pay an amount of Unity determined by empire size to increase support by +5 each time

An election will immediately take place if the ruler dies.

## Government type

Aside from setting the default name of the Ruler council position and deciding the first AI message when establishing communications, government types also decide which leader classes will have increased support during democratic elections.

The rules are not dissimilar from an AI Personality: Certain requirements must be met and every value has a weight – which can be modified by certain factors – with the highest weighted option being used. Governments that are not assigned due to a special civic or a weight multiplier always have the Spiritualist or Materialist option as the highest weighted priority if either of the two ethics are chosen, even if either Militarist or Pacifist are set to Fanatic. However, Militarist civic government options tiebreak to override Materialist civic government options if both are the same weight, and Spiritualist civic governments of the same weight as Militarist ones override them in turn.

Certain civics, such as Warrior Culture, override ones of the same weight and Ethic type. In the case of Warrior Culture, it takes precedence over Citizen Service.
