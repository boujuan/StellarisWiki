# Collection

The **collection** contains every specimen obtained by an empire . Specimens can be obtained from events or discoveries . Specimens can be displayed if the empire has the Galactic Archivism technology and a Grand Archive megastructure, which provides various benefits but also has an Energy upkeep which is increased by Empire Size. Hovering over a specimen will also display the date it was collected. Specimens can be sold for Energy and the storage can be set to automatically sell specimens of a certain rarity.

Each empire can store up to 9 specimens ready for exhibition from each category and can store an additional 18 specimens of any category. If this storage is full, any newly collected specimens will be sold. Specimens can be stolen if the starbase of the system containing the Grand Archive megastructure is occupied, which will also destroy the megastructure. One specimen from each category will be stolen, or two if the attacking empire has the Barbaric Despoilers civic.

Shortly after the first specimen is obtained, the empire will have the option to pay 1000 Energy to unlock the Galactic Archivism technology as a research option with 50% progress.

Specimens can be traded with other empires, with trade acceptance depending on the rarity of the specimen. If a specimen is obtained via trade, obtaining it normally will not give another copy.

## Rarity

Its partial functionality after years of decay is a testament to its sturdy construction. | Rare | +7% Ship Hull Points | Ancient Drones | Galactic History |
| **Figurehead of the Hyacinth** The recovered ornamental figurehead from the doomed voyage of the Hyacinth ark ship. After a serious reactor malfunction, the ark ship was left without power and stranded in the depths of space. Colonists fought over dwindling resources before eventually starving to death. The figurehead bears several inspirational inscriptions and symbols of hope. | **Epic** | +10% Ship Hull Points | The Hunt for the Hyacinth | Galactic History |
| **Head of the Beast** The remains of a dangerous mutant that terrorized colonists on [collection source]. This beast was created by malfunctioning terraforming nanites that had been left behind by an unknown civilization. As intelligent as it was horrific, this creature sheltered in a nest constructed of hundreds of severed body parts. It was thoughtful enough to keep its extra food as prisoners, storing them for later consumption. Were it not for the intervention of military forces, this organism would have continued to thrive on its homeworld as a new type of super predator. | **Epic** | Upkeep −15% Leader Upkeep | Abandoned Terraforming Equipment | Galactic History |
| **Terraforming Machinery** Tiny devices used as part of an ancient form of terraforming technology. These miniature machines were designed to spread out across a planet's surface and convert the existing organic and mineral matter to suit a more desirable climate.

| **Fragmented Zroni Archive** A large datacrystal found on [collection source] from an ancient colony known as the Zroni. It contains a fragmented history of a powerful civilization with an innate psionic ability. Their ability to traverse the Shroud freely was made possible by a breakthrough from a legendary elder known only as the "Far-Seer". Within the Shroud, this species' power was so complete that it could reasonably be mistaken as a form of godhood. Unfortunately, later data is completely corrupted. | **Common** | +5 Unity | Zroni | Galactic History |
| **Zroni War Banners** Recovered banners of the two factions involved in the Zroni civil war. The purple flag represents The Divine: a small minority whose quest for omnipotence placed the galaxy at risk.
