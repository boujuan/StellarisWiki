# Species

Any habitable world has the potential of developing different populations of intelligent beings that may, naturally or not , develop technologically. Sometimes, such beings reach a crucial point in their development that allows them access to FTL technology and, as a consequence, the ability to become full-fledged interstellar empires.

A **species** is distinct from an empire , as a population of any given species can in theory function as fully-fledged citizens of any given empire, however every empire will be assigned a specific founder species (designed through the empire creation screen) that is treated as the default in species rights and other mechanics. At first, every empire will be made up entirely of its original species but may eventually come to include other species through conquest, migration pacts, enlightening pre-FTL cultures, accepting refugees, or some events.

## Species identity

At galaxy generation, species are divided into species class groups, parent species, and sub-species.

Playable portraits are divided into 13 classes representing the basic commonalities of their biology as well as their closest analogues on Earth, including their morphology or physical form and structure, their developmental processes and their biochemical and physiological properties. The 14th Machine species class is available either through constructing robot pops or by playing a machine species, and includes mechanical representations of each of the twelve organic classes. Some archetypes allow access to special traits or civics and/or are only available with DLC.

Species within the same class will be less affected by xenophobia and xenophilia, and even less if they share the same portrait. If two species are created during galaxy generation with the same portrait and name, one will be considered the subspecies of the other.

A parent species is whichever subspecies can be considered the "default" that other subspecies can be derived from. A sub-species consists of a pop modification template created from the parent species or another sub-species, which can then be applied either through a modify species special project, through Assimilation citizenship, or through pop construction. Subspecies are considered to be the same species for the purposes of xenophobia, xenophilia and species rights. All species templates will also remember the parent species' homeworld, with a +30% habitability bonus.

Machine species can change their portrait at any point through pop modification. Other species can only do it if they have one of the following biological ascension traditions:

- Engineered Genesis
- Exemplary Genetics
- Somatic Synthetization
- Unnatural Selection

## Species classes

Each species portrait available to start a new empire will belong to one of the following classes: Arthropoid (arthropod-like), Avian (bird-like), Fungoid (fungus-like), Humanoid (human-like), Mammalian (mammal-like), Molluscoid (mollusc-like), Reptilian (reptile-like), Plantoid, Lithoid, Necroid, Aquatic, Toxoid and Machine.

Depending on installed DLCs, species may have traits are are only available for that species class. If a portrait visibly displays a trait, the trait will be selectable even if the species class does not match.

The first ruler of every empire can be customized.

Portraits that have integrated technology cannot appear as pre-FTL species.

**Humanoid**

Humanoids are species that look similar to humans in both body and head shape. Humanoid shipset and city appearance are accessible only with Humanoids Species Pack active.

Most humanoid portraits use different models and voices for each gender. Some portraits feature their own diplomacy voices and/or hair customization.

## Cybernetic evolution portraits

Cybernetic evolution portraits have 3 possible variants, called evolution stages. Evolution stage 1 is used if the species does not have the Cybernetic, Limited Cybernetic or Ritualistic Implants trait. Evolution stage 2 is used if the species has the Limited Cybernetic, Ritualistic Implants, Cyber Commandos, Cyber Shock Troops or Cyber Soldiers traits. Evolution stage 3 is used if the species has the Cybernetic trait. Evolution stages can be previewed on the ruler at empire creation but afterwards the ruler will still use the evolution stage matching its traits.

There are similar mechanics for synthetic evolution portraits, with 2 possible variants: Evolution stage 1 for Organic pops, and stage 2 for corresponding Machine & Mechanical pops.

Moreover, as the evolution stage changes, the portraits' diplomacy voices would change as well.

| Stage 1 | | Stage 2 | | Stage 3 | | Species class |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cyber 01 stage 1 | | Cyber 01 stage 2 | | Cyber 01 stage 3 | | Mammalian |

## Species-specific text

Each species will be assigned a Nameset at generation, which can be chosen from a total of 60 options consisting of four sets for each of the thirteen species classes, in addition to two sets for Hive Minds, two sets for Individualistic Robots, and United Nations of Earth , Commonwealth of Man , Senatus Populusque Romanus , and Cyberpunk sets for Humans. A nameset outlines the different pools of random names used for leaders , ships (disincluding ship prefixes), colonies, and fleets within an empire of that founder species, though leader names will also carry over to full citizenship pops in other empires. Synthetic pops created by organic empires will typically adopt the nameset of the species that created them.

Each class contains a small bank of preset names for the species, homeworld, and home star system in matching sets. Computer-generated empires will always use a matched species-planet-system set in addition to one of the four class namesets. Human empires will instead use either the UNE or CoM namesets at random. The Hive Mind and SPQR sets do not appear except through the custom empire creation options.

When contacted, empires with a high opinion may compliment you while those with a low opinion may insult you. The flavor text depends on the ruler's species. Species that wear and do not wear clothes also have a special diplomatic insult with each other. Species class also determines the name of the pre-FTL world in the starting system of empires with the Fear of the Dark origin.

In addition to dialogues, many messages will use strings specific to species classes to refer to other things (e.g. organs and fossils).
