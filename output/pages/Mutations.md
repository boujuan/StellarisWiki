# Mutations

Mutations are components that can be added to space fauna. Each space fauna can have 3 mutations if the Controlled Mutations technology has been researched and 6 mutations if the Advanced Controlled Mutations technology has been researched. Mutations grow in strength with the growth stage of the space creature. Mutations also have a basic resources cost that depends on the cloned space fauna.

## Defensive mutations

Defensive mutations increase the durability of a creature by providing extra hit points. These come in three forms: shields, armor, and hull.

### Shields

Shields form the first layer of hit points of a creature. They are effective against energy weapons but vulnerable to kinetic weapons.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cost | Shield Shields | Shield Regen | Cost | Shield Shields | Shield Regen | Cost | Shield Shields | Shield Regen | Cost | Shield Shields | Shield Regen | | |
| **Energy Epidermis** Integrating field manipulators into the creature's epidermis allows a creature to create a stable energy barrier, enhancing their survivability. | | 35 | 0.2 | | 75 | 0.5 | | 190 | 1.2 | | 450 | 3 | |
| **Improved Energy Epidermis** A reinforced version of the epidermal energy barrier has been made possible by the optimization of internal chemical energy conversion. | | 45 | 0.2 | | 100 | 0.6 | | 250 | 1.5 | | 600 | 4 | |
| **High Energy Skin** Grafting a new epidermis filled with bio-energy projectors allows for the formation of intricate and layered defense fields, increasing a creature's resilience. | | 55 | 0.3 | | 125 | 0.8 | | 315 | 2.1 | | 750 | 5.1 | |
| **Advanced Energy Skin** Augmentations to the power output of the bio-energetic epidermis creates an even stronger defensive field that can only be breached by sustained enemy fire. | 0.13 | 70 | 0.4 | 0.25 | 165 | 1.1 | 0.5 | 415 | 2.7 | 1 | 990 | 6.6 | |

| **Null Void Epidermis** This energy epidermis draws its power from the Null Void Dimension, allowing it to endlessly regenerate any loss in its integrity. | | 45 | 0.6 | | 100 | 1.45 | | 250 | 3.65 | | 600 | 8.7 | - Can only be acquired via The Doorway event<br>- If the space fauna has a Psi-Phasing Skin cloaking does not nullify shields |
| **Psionic Skin** High-grade epidermal field generators that harness the power of the Shroud. It projects a near-unbreakable defensive barrier that can cause projectiles to vanish on contact. | 0.06 | 150 | 0.9 | 0.11 | 360 | 2 | 0.22 | 900 | 5 | 0.33 | 2160 | 12.5 | - Can only be acquired as a psionically ascended empire through Shroud events<br>- If the space fauna has a Psi-Phasing Skin cloaking does not nullify shields |
| **Ancient Suspension Epidermis** Inspired by ancient suspension fields, the bio-generators present in this barrier epidermis are able to reject penetrative munitions on contact. | 6 | 55 | 0.8 | 8 | 125 | 1.8 | 10 | 315 | 4.6 | 12 | 750 | 11.1 | - Also provides +15% Shield Hardening<br>- The Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk increases shield hit points by 60% |

### Carapace

Armor forms the second layer of hit points of a creature. They are effective against kinetic weapons but vulnerable to energy weapons.

| **Ceramo-Chitin Carapace** Reinforcement of a creature's natural armor with microscopic ceramic compounds increases survivability. | | 50 | | 130 | | 325 | | 780 | |
| **Plasteel Carapace** Precise genome alterations allow for the integration of plasteel into a creature's carapace. | | 65 | | 170 | | 425 | | 1020 | |
| **Durasteel Carapace** The organic growth of durasteel armor plates makes creatures more resistant to damage from munitions. | | 90 | | 220 | | 550 | | 1320 | |
| **Neutronium Carapace** Stimulating the growth of Neutronium armor plates requires pushing the creature's genome to its limits. This extraordinarily robust carapace can withstand damage that would liquify other defenses. | | 120 | | 290 | | 725 | | 1740 | |
| **Draconic Carapace** Through the analysis of the space dragon's genome, we've gained the essential tools to splice its genetic material with our creatures'. This fusion would enable the growth of impossibly strong dragon scales atop their carapaces, significantly enhancing their survivability. | | 150 | | 370 | | 925 | | 2220 | - Can only be acquired by defeating a space dragon guardian or Cosmogenesis crisis progression |
| **Ancient Energized Carapace** Ionized plates of armor can carry a reactive charge to alleviate the energy of impacts, using magnetic repulsion and field projection principles. | 6 | 65 | 8 | 170 | 10 | 425 | 12 | 1020 | - Also includes the effects of Energy Epidermis<br>- The Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk doubles shield hit points |

### Innards

Hull is the last layer of a creature's hit points; the creature is killed if the hull points reach 0. All creatures have some inherent hull points; this can be increased with these Innards components.

These can be acquired either by completing the Crystalline Entity event chain, by reverse-engineering destroyed Crystalline Entities, or through searching an abandoned ship left by Caravaneers .
