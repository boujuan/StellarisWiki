# Planet modifiers

Each planet has a small chance of containing a modifier that will affect the colony should the world be colonized. They may be positive, negative or mixed, identified by the color of the modifier's border.

Random anomalies can generate a great variety of planet modifiers but those usually do not have any effects.

## Random modifiers

These modifiers can appear at random on any planet outside an empire's home system. If terraforming technology is researched, some of them can be removed either via a special decision or by terraforming the planet. A planet can have up to 2 random modifiers.

| | Modifier | Effects | Spawn chance | Removed by terraforming | DLC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | **Tidal Locked** This world is tidally locked around its star, meaning that one side always has daylight while the other is locked in eternal darkness. If life exists here, it is likely limited to the twilight regions where the two sides meet. | - −30% Max Districts<br>- −3 Max Agriculture Districts<br>- Enables the Day Farm Construction decision | - ×3 if moon<br>- ×0 if Gaia World<br>- ×0 if Volcanic World<br>- Always present on Proxima Centauri b | No | |

### Mineral quality modifiers

Each planet can only have one mineral quality modifier, which affects the number of Mining Districts that can be built and their job output. They are not removed if the planet is terraformed.

| | Modifier | Effects | Spawn chance |
|---|---|---|---|
| | **Poor Quality Minerals** It is unknown if this planet simply formed this way, or if some unknown race once stripped it of its more valuable resources. However, we do know that the minerals present on this planet are of unusually poor quality. | - −3 Max Mining Districts<br>- −25% Minerals from Jobs | - ×4 if Low Gravity<br>- ×0 if Gaia World |

| | **Exceptional Quality Minerals** The exceptional quality of the minerals in this planet's crust provides a truly staggering opportunity for mining. | - +8 Max Mining Districts<br>- +25% Minerals from Jobs | ×8 if High Gravity |

### Orbital deposit modifiers

The following modifiers add a deposit of +6 minerals when surveyed. They only appear on uninhabitable planets.

| | Modifier | Planet class | Spawn chance |
|---|---|---|---|
| | **Extensive Moon System** This gas giant has an unusually large amount of natural satellites. Hundreds of small moons and moonlets orbit the planet. | Gas Giant | - ×2 if 3+ moons<br>- ×2 if 2+ moons<br>- ×0 if no moons |
| | **Carbon World** This world has been formed mostly out of carbon, and contains little oxygen. | Barren | - ×4 if High Gravity<br>- ×0 if Poor Quality Minerals |
| | **Chthonian Planet** This planet was once a gas giant, but its proximity to its star has burned away the thick atmosphere. All that remains now is a super-dense and mineral rich metallic core. | Molten | ×0 if Poor Quality Minerals |

### Terraforming candidates

Terraforming Candidates are modifiers that have a small chance to appear on uninhabitable planets and are always added to worlds ruined by a crisis. The modifiers allow the planet to be terraformed if the Climate Restoration technology has been researched. They do not appear if the required expansion is not installed. The chance for a planet to have the modifier is scaled by the Habitable Worlds game setting .

| | Modifier | Planet | Chance | Required perk | DLC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | **Terraforming Candidate** Though barren and devoid of life, this planet has water in frozen form and may once have been home to a thriving ecosystem. With the right technology, it could be terraformed into a habitable world. | Barren | 1% | — | |
| | **Frozen Terraforming Candidate** Though cold to the point of being unable to sustain life, the frozen water on this world could allow us to terraform it into a habitable world, if we can find the right method. | Frozen | 1% | Hydrocentric | |
| | **Toxic Terraforming Candidate** Though the noxious gases on this world make it unfit for life, with enough effort they can be broken down into less lethal compounds, eventually allowing colonization. | Toxic | 15% | Detox | |
