# Biological traits

Biological traits are available for species with the Organic, Lithoid and Thermophile primary trait. They can be changed through genetic modification, which requires the Gene Tailoring technology.

## Climate preference traits

Each species has a climate preference trait that determines their base Habitability on the various types of planets, usually that corresponding to the type of their homeworld. It also decides the background that will be used when viewing the template in the species menu.

Climate preference traits can be changed after researching the Glandular Acclimation technology but a pop can never have more than one climate preference trait. Climate preference cannot be changed if the species has the Aquatic trait.

| Trait | Effects | Description | Trait | Effects | Description |
| Cyber Commandos | - Commanders have the Cyber Commando III trait<br>- +75% Army damage<br>- −20% Pop growth speed<br>- +30% Happiness when at war or crisis | Total limb replacements and bonded nanomesh body armor ensure these cyborgs can wage war with brutal efficiency. As a consequence, several non-military bodily functions have been sacrificed. | Unplugged | - +1 Pop amenities usage<br>- −10 Happiness when not at war or crisis<br>- −20 Years leader lifespan | Several of these cyborgs' augments were designed to utilize a battlefield network which no longer exists, causing intense stress and discomfort. |
| Cyber Shock Troops | - Commanders have the Cyber Commando II trait<br>- +50% Army damage<br>- −10% Pop growth speed | These cyborgs benefit from a holistic approach to embodied loadouts. Rather than fully-integrated body armor, swappable augments allow for a modicum of non-military function. | Disconnected | - +1 Pop amenities usage<br>- −10 Happiness when not at war or crisis | The ill-fitting nature of these cyborgs' imposed, military augments greatly reduces their quality of life and increases their bodies' demands during periods of rehabilitation. |
| Cyber Soldiers | - Commanders have the Cyber Commando trait<br>- +25% Army damage | Elegant augmentations to these cyborgs' senses, glands, and motor nerves ensure they remain fierce and capable warriors while only marginally impacting their reproductive capabilities. | Haunted | +1 Pop amenities usage | Auditory hallucinations and other sensory echoes from their former machine consciousness still haunt these cyborgs, causing them to suffer severe bouts of depression and anxiety. |
| De-Cyberized | - +5% Happiness<br>- +20% Governing ethics attraction<br>- +10% Job efficiency for Biologists and Bureaucrats | These ex-cyborgs have disabled or cast off the augments which had once been forced upon them, reclaiming many of their species' organic, inherited attributes. | | | |

Roughly a year after the Embodied Identity situation has been concluded, if the founder species does not have the De-Cyberized trait the empire will be offered the option to gain one of three traits for the founder species:

| Trait | Effects | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Neuro-Calmed | - −5% Empire size from pops<br>- +15% Governing ethics attraction | These cyborgs have their Neuroxene levels downregulated, reducing impulsivity and aggression, driving individuals to de-prioritize personal gain in favor of societal norms. |
| Neuro-Savant | - +10% Leader experience gain<br>- −1 Leader maximum negative traits | These cyborgs have their Cognivex levels upregulated, enhancing synaptic plasticity, information retention, and problem-solving abilities. |
| Regen-Optimized | - +10% Habitability<br>- +10% Pop growth speed | These cyborgs have their Regenol-X levels upregulated, harmonizing biological and synthetic systems, allowing cybernetic implants to self-repair at the molecular level. |

### Clone Army traits

Empires with the Clone Army origin start the game with the Clone Soldier trait. After completing the Homeworld Excavation archaeology site, the empire gets the Genetic Crossroads event chain, allowing it to choose between replacing the trait with Clone Soldier Descendant or Clone Soldier Ascendant. Each of the Clone Solder traits adds a corresponding Commander trait. None of the Clone Soldier traits can be removed and they do not cost any trait points.

Pops with the Clone Soldier or Clone Soldier Ascendant traits cannot reproduce naturally, must be assembled and sustained by the Ancient Clone Vat buildings, and will decline with insufficient buildings. They cannot be sold on the slave market or used as a founder species in a released sector, and cannot be genetically modified without adopting the Clone Synthetization tradition after choosing the Clone Potential path.

Ascended Clone Army empires that adopted Cloning traditions can support additional pops through Clone Vats , Gene Clinics , and Genomic Research Facilities . The Clone Synthetization tradition will also allow them to genetically modify Clone Soldier pops and add the Clone Soldier trait to other species. The sustained pop limit is shared by all Clone Soldier pops regardless of species.

| Trait | Effects | Commander trait | Conflicts | | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Clone Soldier | - +50% Governing ethics attraction<br>- +50% Army damage<br>- Upkeep +25% Pop upkeep<br>- −40 Years leader lifespan<br>- Cannot reproduce naturally<br>- Decline without sufficient Clone Vat buildings | Clone Army Commander | | No | Engineered for compliance and war: short-lived, unable to reproduce naturally, and very efficient. |
| Clone Soldier Ascendant | - +50% Governing ethics attraction<br>- +20% Habitability<br>- +40% Elite job efficiency<br>- +25% Specialist job efficiency<br>- +75% Army damage<br>- +25% Army health<br>- Upkeep +30% Pop upkeep<br>- Cannot reproduce naturally<br>- Decline without sufficient Clone Vat buildings | Ascendant Clone Army Commander | | No | Clones at their genetically-engineered peak, with further improved strength, efficiency, durability, and longevity - but forever infertile. |
| Clone Soldier Descendant | - +20% Governing ethics attraction<br>- +20% Army damage<br>- Upkeep +10% Pop upkeep | Descendant Clone Army Commander | | +1000 | Once infertile, engineered for compliance and war. Their genetic edge diminished, they are now stable enough for natural reproduction. |

### Overtuned traits

Empires with the Overtuned origin can select these traits in empire creation and change them through genetic modification. They can also be removed by empires with the Genetic Resequencing or Genotype Regeneration tradition. Overtuned traits provide bonuses similar to basic traits for less points but also reduce leader lifespan and pop growth speed. Overtuned traits have their effects doubled by the Damn the Consequences edict.

| Trait | Effects | Lifespan | Growth Speed | | | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Augmented Intelligence | +10% Research job efficiency | −10 years | −1.5% | 1 | +1000 | More brains equals more brain power. Extra thinking organs have been added in strategic areas of the recipient's body to ensure maximum cognitive capacity. Even if they don't always agree. |

| Farm Appendages | +15% Farmer job efficiency | −10 years | −1.5% | 1 | +1000 | The more appendages, the higher the farming output. Some appendages can even operate while their host is asleep. Rumors of hosts strangled by their new limbs have been deemed unfounded in our latest investigation. |
| Gene Mentorship | +25% Leader experience gain | −10 years | −1.5% | 1 | +1000 | By combining genetically redesigned 'instinctive knowledge' and outside chemical stimuli, we have succeeded in vastly accelerating our learning capacities. Although it has resulted in some extremely paranoid individuals. |
| Juiced Power | - +40% Army damage<br>- +5% Worker job efficiency<br>- +5% Menial Drone job efficiency | −10 years | −1.5% | 1 | +1000 | Adrenaline released on demand and hyper-potent growth hormones have led to a massive increase in strength. Just ignore the occasional internal tearing. |
| Low Maintenance | −10% Pop consumer goods upkeep | −10 years | −1.5% | 1 | +1000 | Reduced consumption, excretion, and rest rates have resulted in twice the beings for half the price. However, demand for protein-rich meals has increased. |
| Spliced Adaptability | +20% Habitability | −10 years | −1.5% | 1 | +1000 | A few genetic snips and slices here and there and they can survive nearly anywhere. The process comes with an acceptable number of deaths from side effects. |
| Technical Talent | +15% Technician job efficiency | −10 years | −1.5% | 1 | +1000 | Extra internal organs grant a vastly increased innate sensitivity to electricity and magnetic fields. Reports of recipients hearing screams and voices from the reactors should be ignored. |
| Fleeting Excellence | Feature Enables Auto-Modding | −20 years | | 2 | +1000 | Advanced epigenetic triggers boost physical and cognitive performance in the workplace, dramatically shortening life expectancy. After all, fading away is never as much fun as burning out. |
| Elevated Synapses | - +20% Research job efficiency<br>- Upkeep −25% Leader upkeep<br>- −1 Leader maximum negative traits | −30 years | −5% | 2 | +2000 | As a computational device, a brain does not run at 100% capacity. However, we have gone beyond the standard usage. If issues are encountered, try turning it off and on again. |
| Pre-Planned Growth | - −10% Pop housing usage<br>- Upkeep +15% Pop upkeep | −30 years | +30% | 2 | +2000 | Scheduled fertility, scheduled interest, scheduled compatibility. Population growth on demand for a strong and stable population - with a few minor edits here and there. Jealous individuals are to be directed to the nearest Fertility Center for mandatory training. |
| Excessive Endurance | - +5% Job efficiency<br>- +30% Habitability | −30 years | −5% | 3 | +2000 | The greatest in adaptability genes have been hyper-expressed in these specimens. Mutation rates around 30% indicate a somewhat stable and successful experiment. |

### Cybernetic Creed traits

Empires with the Cybernetic Creed origin will begin with the Ritualistic Implants and can replace it with a faction-specific trait during the The Conclave of Fusion situation. Each of these traits gives Spiritualist leaders the Ritualistic Implants trait, increases the pops' price on the slave market by +500 and prevents the species from being modified until the The Conclave of Fusion situation ends. The traits are removed if the pop is not Spiritualist or is assimilated to remove cybernetic traits.

| Trait | Effects | Creed | Description |

## Pre-sapient traits

Pre-sapient species have exclusive traits that cannot otherwise be chosen when creating or modifying a species. They retain these traits after being uplifted as a sapient species and the traits do not cost any trait points. A few pre-sapient traits are found only in certain species but can also be added if a sapient species is turned pre-sapient by a covenant with the Composer of Strands. They can be removed from templates if the empire has one of the following:

- Epigenetic Triggers technology
- Genetic Resequencing tradition
- Genotype Regeneration tradition

### Biological ascension traits

Biological ascension traits are unlocked for genetic modification through biological ascension traditions.

#### Advanced genetic traits

Advanced genetic traits are unlocked for genetic modification by the Allelic Expression or Exemplary Genetics or Unnatural Selection traditions. They can only be removed by empires that have the Genetic Resequencing or Genotype Regeneration or Unnatural Selection traditions.

If the empire has the Exemplary Genetics tradition, all of these traits except Exotic Metabolism have their cost reduced by −1 , while their cost for Species Genetic Perfection calculation of purity authorities are not changed.

If the empire has the Somatic Synthesization tradition, the Vat-Grown trait can be added or removed regardless of other requirements, and has its cost reduced to 0.

### Cyborg traits

Cyborg traits can be added to or removed from a Cybernetic species if the empire has the Integrated Anatomy tradition. They are removed if the species is assimilated to remove cybernetic traits.

Empires with the Hard Reset origin or the Augmentation Bazaars civic can select some of these traits at empire creation and add or remove them through species modification.

#### Positive cyborg traits
