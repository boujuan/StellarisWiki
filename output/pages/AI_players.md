# AI players

**AI players** refers to regular empires that are controlled by the AI. Unlike human players, the AI is relatively predictable as it follows a set of scripted guidelines and subroutines.

Additionally, Fallen Empires , though AI-controlled, have several special behaviors not listed here. For details on that, see their respective article.

## Personalities

While the below text details the general behavior of all AIs, the personalities of some AIs will alter or even overwrite some of the behaviors. For the full list of personalities and how they affect the AI, see AI personalities .

## Expansion

- AI players will always build starbases in systems that have various features in the following order:
 1. Gateway / Wormhole / Colonizable planets
 2. Resource deposits
 3. Any other systems.

- AI players will always upgrade starbases in systems that have various features in the following order:
 1. Gateway/Wormhole
 2. Megastructure
 3. Colonized planets
 4. Uncolonized habitable planets
 5. Hyperlane choke point
 6. Uninhabitable/any other systems

- AI players will only build starbases up to two hyperlanes away from their nearest owned system.
- AI players will only colonize worlds that have at least 35% Habitability for any of their species.
- AI players will always try to have 1 colony ship, 4 construction ships and 4 science ships active at any given time.
- AI players will only construct districts on planets that have less than 2 open jobs and will only construct buildings on planets that have less than 3 open jobs.
- AI players will always construct their first hyper relay in the capital system and then in the adjacent systems, building outwards from there.
- AI players will always construct their first habitat in the core sector.
- AI players have a limit on how many habitats they make use of; it ranges from a base of 2 on Tiny galaxies to 10 on Huge galaxies, which is further modified by game difficulty - divided by two on Civilian up to multiplied by two on Grand Admiral. The Void Dwellers origin then doubles it again. This limit includes all habitats in owned systems, even if uncolonised.

## Claims

- AI players that are independent will only make Claims on systems up to 4 hyperlane jumps away from owned systems.
- AI players that are subjects will only make Claims on systems up to 2 hyperlane jumps away from owned systems.
- AI players will always claim systems that have various features in the following order:
 1. Directly bordering them
 2. Colonized habitable planet(s)
 3. Gateway/Wormhole
 4. Resource deposits
 5. Any other systems.

- AI players will never boost their claims by re-claiming already claimed systems

## Aggressiveness

- AI players are 2 times more likely to declare war if they can't expand in systems with habitable planets.
- AI players are 4 times more likely to declare war if they can't expand in any system.
- AI players are 10 times more likely to declare war if they can't expand and are Hive Mind or Driven Assimilator.

## Warfare

- AI players will exceed their Naval Capacity when preparing for war or when at war.
- AI players will only declare one war at a time.
- AI players will redesign their ships accordingly if they encounter specialised enemy ships, to counter said ships.
- AI players will only declare war when they use at least 50% of their naval capacity and have at least 6 assault armies recruited.
- AI players will only attack systems if their Fleet Power is 20% stronger than that of any hostile fleets in said system(s).
- AI players will always retreat when they have lost 50% of a fleet in a space battle.
 - This value can change depending on their "Combat Bravery" value, which itself depends on their AI Personality.
 - A Combat Bravery value of 1.0 means retreat at 50% losses and 2.0 means no retreat no matter what.

- AI players will never retreat from a space battle if they own less than 3 systems (Combat Bravery will be set to 2.0).
- AI players will never defend attacked systems if their Fleet Power is lower than that of the opponent’s.
- AI players will never upgrade ships while at war. They will, however, redesign them as needed to counter enemy ships.
- AI players will always use Selective orbital bombardment stance if their attitude towards the planet owner is not hostile , otherwise they will always use highest available orbital bombardment stance (usually Indiscriminate or Armageddon).
- AI players will never FTL-Jump into an enemy system unless the jumping fleet fleet has at least 33% more Fleet Power than any hostile fleets in the targeted system.
- AI players will always attack targets in the following order:
 1. Owned systems occupied by an enemy
 2. Hostile fleets weakened by use of Jump Drive
 3. Enemy systems with colonies
 4. Enemy systems with upgraded starbases / Hostile fleets (anywhere nearby) / Enemy systems they have claimed
 5. Any other valid targets

## Slave Market

- AI players will not buy slaves if they have less than 1000 Energy.
- AI players will not sell slaves if they have more than 3000 Energy.
- AI players will always sell a Pop if they have at least 3 Unemployed Pops on a planet.
- AI players will always sell a Pop if they have at least 6 Unemployed Pops across the empire.

## Ships

- AI players will always use private colony ships if they can build them.
- AI players will always build a Titan if they have the technology, with one additional Titan for every 10 planets they own, up to a maximum of 15.
- AI players will only build a Star-Eater if both initial ones were destroyed.

## Other

- AI players will never spawn with the Doomsday origin unless force-spawned with it, as they do not know how to properly handle it.
- AI players will never use Ambition Edicts until they have unlocked all Traditions .
- AI players will never Embrace a Faction unless more than 50% of its population belong to it.
- AI players will never sell more than 30% of their stockpile for any resource.
- AI players will not send a diplomatic request of the same type for 27 years if the previous one was rejected.
- AI players will only consecrate habitable planets that have below 35% Habitability.
- AI players will only attack Guardians if they have at least 40k Fleet Power and 20% more Fleet Power overall than said Guardian.
- AI players that are Genocidal will attack enclaves once their Fleet Power is twice stronger.
- AI players will only use Sacrifice Edicts if at least 60 years have passed and they have at least 3 Mortal Initiate jobs taken.
- AI players will infiltrate empires with the following priority:
 1. Rivals
 2. Level 2 (or higher) Crisis empires
 3. Neighbors not in the same federation
 4. Any other empires.

- AI players will end any Secret Fealty if their Loyalty reaches at least 30.
- AI players will only strengthen Imperial Authority if their relations with the galactic emperor are Positive or Excellent .
 - Otherwise, they may undermine Imperial Authority, with the likelihood depending on how bad their relations are with the galactic emperor.
 - AI empires rivalled to the galactic emperor will always undermine Imperial Authority whenever they can do it.

- AI players will always use one-time Astral Actions before repeatable ones.
- AI players will not adopt the Virtuality tradition.
- AI players will engage in slavery if their ethics and policies allow it.
- AI players will not engage in purging unless they are xenophobic and/or Genocidal.
 - If not genocidal, they will use Displacement or Neutering.
 - If Fanatic Purifiers, they will use Extermination or Forced Labor
 - If Devouring Swarm, they will use Processing
 - If Determined Exterminators, they will use Chemical Processing

## Economy

AI players will always try to have the following production surplus:

| Income | Condition |
|---|---|
| +25 Energy | Always |
| +50 Minerals | Always |
| +4 Exotic Gases | Always |
| +4 Rare Crystals | |
| +4 Volatile Motes | |
| +10 Food | Yes Uses the resource |
| +70 Engineering Research | - > +10 Consumer Goods if not Gestalt Consciousness<br>- > +30 Minerals if Hive Mind<br>- > +25 Energy if Machine Intelligence |
| +70 Physics Research | |
| +70 Society Research | |
| +15 Alloys | Machine Intelligence |
| +10 Consumer Goods | - Yes Uses the resource<br>- > +25 Energy<br>- > +50 Minerals<br>- > +10 Food if uses the resource |
| +20 Food | - Yes Uses the resource<br>- > +70 Engineering Research<br>- > +70 Physics Research<br>- > +70 Energy Society Research |
| +9000 Pops | - > +25 Energy<br>- > +50 Minerals<br>- > +70 Engineering Research<br>- > +70 Physics Research<br>- > +70 Society Research |

Once all objectives aside from pops and advanced resources have been achieved the AI will increase all values by the following:

- +10 Energy
- +10 Minerals
- +10 Unity
- +10 Alloys
- +25 Engineering Research
- +25 Physics Research
- +25 Society Research
- +1 Consumer Goods if uses the resources

Once all new increased values have been reached the AI will increase them again, repeating the process.

As a counterbalance to player ingenuity, AI players are allowed to buy resources from the Market with no Market Fee to prevent and resolve any resource shortages. On higher difficulties, AI players will be allowed to buy resources completely for free. AI players will use the Galactic Market if they have access to it, and use the Internal Market otherwise.

AI players will never use monthly trades on the market, they will always buy resources in bulk in a single action.

## Military Composition

Different AI players will prefer different ship sizes and different weapon types over others, depending on their AI personality . They will, however, disregard these preferences if the situation requires it. AI players will always try to build ships of all hull sizes they have researched and will seek to consolidate their fleets as much as their Fleet Command Limit will allow. Excess ships will be placed in an additional fleet and will follow the main fleet. AI players will upgrade Starbases but will never build Defence Platforms around them. AI empires that are militaristic will prioritise resources for their military over research, particularly in the early game or when preparing for war or when at war.

AI players will always try to have 10 armies, with an additional army for every 50 Pops up to a cap of 50 armies. Army transports will always use the Evasive fleet stance. AI players will always recruit only one type of army, with the following conditions:

| Army | Conditions |
|---|---|
| Assault Army | - No Telepathy technology<br>- No Gene Seed Purification technology<br>- No Neural Implants technology and uses slaves<br>- No Droids technology and Artificial Intelligence policy is set to Citizen Rights<br>- No Gene Banks technology and Militarist or Fanatic Militarist |
| Slave Army | - Yes Neural Implants technology and uses slaves<br>- No Telepathy technology<br>- No Gene Seed Purification technology<br>- No Gene Banks technology and Militarist or Fanatic Militarist |
