# Stat modifiers

Behind a veneer of gameplay mechanics, narrative stories and compelling roleplay opportunities Stellaris is, to a large extent, a numbers game. There are a multitude of different stats and calculated modifiers thereof that determine how different things work and in what magnitudes. These stat modifiers are important knowledge for those seeking to optimize their gameplay experience or simply get things done more efficiently. This page lists all major stat modifiers that increase or decrease a certain stat, as well as their sources. Cost reduction stats are capped, usually at −90% , but certain other stats can reach higher or lower.
