# Planet capital

The capital always occupies the first building slot and provides some of the basic housing, amenities, defense armies, jobs that reduce crime, as well as other jobs which vary depending on empire authority and civics. Upgrading the capital is one of the ways of unlocking additional building slots. Capital buildings cannot be demolished, downgraded, disabled, or ruined by orbital bombardment or collateral damage, and are automatically converted to the appropriate type if the planet is traded, ceded, or conquered by another empire with a different authority or if the planet designation is changed.

## Capital tiers

Capital buildings can generally be categorized into 4 tiers by which technology unlocks that tier, what other buildings require them, and the max general productivity bonus that they can apply. The standard capitals line up on these criteria neatly, however other types do not. With Nemesis, the Galactic Emperor can upgrade their empire capital with a "fifth" tier imperial capital building.

| Capital tier | Required technology | Job productivity | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Output | Upkeep Upkeep | Required technology | | |
| II | **Planetary Government** | +10% | +10% | Improved Production |
| III | Colonial Centralization | +20% | +20% | Efficiencies of Scale |
| IV+ | Galactic Administration | +30% | +30% | Maximized Productivity |

Tier IV capitals and Imperial capitals are converted to Tier III and Tier IV capitals respectively, other capitals convert to the same tier unless specified otherwise.

## Standard capitals

The standard set of capitals are built on planets and ring worlds without a special designation by non-gestalt empires. All capitals at tier II or above provide additional +100 housing with Imperious Architecture tradition.

## Machine Intelligence capitals

Machine Intelligence empires have the same four capital tiers as regular empires. Capital conversion works normally, except that the Administrative Array (tier II) will convert to a Reassembled Ship Shelter (tier I) if the planet is conquered by a non-Gestalt empire. Also, the Planetary Processor (tier III) counts as tier IV for building requirements.

Driven Assimilator capitals have −100 Replicators, replaced by Logistics Drones on upgraded capitals, and an additional −100 Replicators on Gestation Worlds, replaced by +200 Gestation Drones.

No If The Machine Age DLC is not enabled, all machine capitals can gain +100 Replicators from the Prefabricated Components tradition.
