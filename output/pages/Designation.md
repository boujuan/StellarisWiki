# Designation

**Designation** represents the production focus on a world and provides a bonus favoring a certain production focus. By default, it is automatically determined by the most common type of district or building constructed but it can be chosen manually at any point.

If automation is turned on, the world builds buildings favoring the designation's bonus unless the planet has low amenities or high crime or deviancy, in which case it first focuses on tackling these issues. Each planetary ascension tier also increases the effects of the planet designation by +25% and reduces size from the colony by −5% , which includes pops, districts and the colony itself. Ascension tiers are not lost if the designation is changed.

Most designations benefit from the Adaptability tradition finisher, and some benefit from certain Galactic Community resolutions .

## Planetary ascension

All worlds can be **ascended** using unity, which increases the effects of the world's designation by +25% and reduces empire size from that planet (from the colony, districts, and pops) by −5% each. If a planet is conquered its ascension level is reset.

The maximum planetary ascension tier depends on the number of unlocked ascension perk slots, with the first tier being unlocked by the third ascension perk slot. Each additional ascension perk unlocked allows an additional planetary ascension tier. Once all eight ascension perk slots have been unlocked, an additional four planetary ascension tiers are unlocked for a maximum of 10, a possible total +250% designation effect increase and −50% reduction in empire size from that planet.

For example, a Generator World with 2 ascension tiers would give a +37.5% bonus to Technician output; i.e. the original +25% bonus, multiplied by a +50% increase.

The effect of planetary ascension can be enhanced by the following bonuses:

| Planetary ascension effect 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Ascensionists civic | +25% |
| - Harmony traditions finished<br>- Synchronicity traditions finished | +25% |
| Heavenly Accord ( Level 3) | +20% |

Planetary designation effects are affected by the following formula:

modifier after planetary ascension = modifier before planetary ascension * (100 + tier * 25 * (100 + X + Y + Z) / 100)/100

where X, Y, Z are the optional bonus source for the enhanced planetary ascension effect from the table above (values: 25 | 20 | 25). A few examples of typical effects values are listed in the table:

| Planetary designation | Effect and its values | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Planetary ascension tiers: | 0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 10† | |
| Urban World | Upkeep Planetary infrastructure upkeep | −10% | −12.5% | −22.5% | −35% | −52.5% |
| Trade from jobs | +20% | +25% | +45% | +70% | +105% | |
| Generator World | Technician output | +25% | +31.25% | +56.25% | +87.5% | +131.25% |
| Forge World | Metallurgist upkeep | −20% | −25% | −45% | −70% | −105% |
| Factory World | Artisan upkeep | −20% | −25% | −45% | −70% | −105% |
| Unification Center | Administrator output | +10% | +12.5% | +22.5% | +35% | +52.5% |
| Administrator upkeep | −10% | −12.5% | −22.5% | −35% | −52.5% | |
| +1 Priests job per _ pops (from Holy Covenant Level 4) | 25 | 20 | 11.1 | 7.1 | 4.8 | |

† with all three bonus sources to enhance the planetary ascension effect

### Ascension cost

The cost of increasing a planet's ascension tier depends on the empire's size and total number of planetary ascension tiers already present in the empire, whether on the same planet or other planets. For example, an empire with 200 size and 3 total ascension tiers (whether from three planets at tier 1, one at tier 3, or one at tier 2 and one at tier 1) would need to spend 5600 unity to increase the ascension tier of a planet. The precise formula is shown below:

ascension unity cost = (empire size * 10) * (1 + 0.6 * total ascension tiers) ; = (200 * 10) * (1 + 0.6 * 3) = 5600

From there, a formula for the total cost of performing n ascensions can be derived:

beginalign total unity cost = (empire size * 10) * (n + 0.6 * n(n - 1) / 2) ; = (200 * 10) * (4 + 0.6 * 4 * 3 / 2) = 15200 endalign
