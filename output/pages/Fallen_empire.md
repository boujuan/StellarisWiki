# Fallen empire

**Fallen Empires** are vestigial remnants of millennia old, extremely powerful empires that have become stagnant and decadent over the ages. They serve as major powers in the galaxy that generally have no interest in the younger species, but will intervene if certain conditions are met. Fallen Empires can serve as important roadblocks to expansion, and angering them can lead to devastating results, for they will very swiftly proceed to crush any upstarts who provoke them and stamp out any opposition through the early-, mid- and lategame. However, should an empire grow powerful enough to eclipse and surpass the Fallen Empires in power, they will be able to soundly defeat them and seize their valuable worlds, resources and technology for themselves, and establish themselves as the new galactic hegemon.

Unlike playable empires, Fallen Empires are fully developed at the start of the game, have all technologies researched, including 10 levels of repeatable technologies, have special Fallen Empire buildings , deep space citadels, and unique and powerful fleets. They always start with two fleets of around 40k-150k Fleet Power and can obtain additional fleets through events. Fallen Empires use a unique shipset exclusive to them; there are visual variants of this style and different weapon and component selections for each type of Fallen Empire but the number of slots is equal. Each Fallen Empire has a 10% chance of starting with a Colossus and a 25% chance of starting with a Paradox Titan.

## General characteristics

There are 6 types of Fallen Empires, and only one of each type can exist in a game. The maximum number of Fallen Empires within the game depends on the galaxy size and game settings . However, if a galaxy is too populated (both regular empires and fallen empires sliders have been set to max), then some Fallen Empires might not be created. This does not happen every time and depends entirely on empire placement. In the Contact list, they are listed under their own section ("Fallen Empires").

Each individualist Fallen Empire is themed around a certain fanatic ethic and unlike conventional empires, they always have only a single ethic. They have Imperial authority and the Lethargic Leadership and Empire In Decline civics, which prevents them from colonizing and conquering worlds or building new ships.

Fallen Empires cannot be subjugated but empires can make claims on their systems regardless of their War Philosophy policy. Empires cannot conduct any form of espionage on Fallen Empires, establish diplomatic agreements with them, or use Envoys to affect relations.

Fallen Empires do not use conventional ships , but instead make use of a separate clade of vessels ; **Riddle Escorts** , **Enigma Battlecruisers** and **Paradox Titans** . These ships are roughly equivalent to Destroyers, Battleships and Titans respectively, but with much greater firepower and component slots. Such ships can only be obtainable by a conventional empire by progressing through the Cosmogenesis crisis tree. Some Fallen Empire systems are also protected by Deep Space Citadels .

A Fallen Empire's species is randomly generated, but there is a 5% chance for them to be picked from any of the preset empires or player-made custom empires if the species in question has not already spawned on the map and has the Fallen Empire's required ethic – fanatic or not. For example, it is possible by default for a human Fallen Empire to be generated as Enigmatic Observers, Militant Isolationists, or Ancient Caretakers based on the Xenophile United Nations of Earth, the Xenophobe Commonwealth of Man, or the Machine Intelligence Earth Custodianship respectively.

Winning the game via Cosmogenesis causes the played empire to be transformed into a Fallen Empire, which is no longer playable. Said Cosmogenesis Fallen Empire will consist of just its capital planet (inhabited by 2000 pops) and starbases in its core sector. It will also retain all subject empires and remain part of any federation it was a member of. This Fallen Empire will gain the same civics as a regular dormant Fallen Empire, but will retain its government authority. Notably, a sector released as a vassal from a Cosmogenesis empire will inherit all technologies from said empire (including all technologies obtained from Cosmogenesis) but not the Cosmogenesis ascension perk, thus making it playable.

## Dormant fallen empires

All fallen empires begin the game in Dormant status. Despite their complete development and immense power, they remain passive – staying within their borders and taking no action unless provoked. Their civics prevent them from expanding or building ships. They can, however, get new fleets (4 Battlecruisers and 8 Escorts) once every decade through an event, if their Fleet Power is below 100K and they are at peace. Dormant Fallen Empires have a hidden modifier that reduces their ship upkeep and build cost by 50%, which is retained when they awaken.

Fallen empires do not trigger a first contact and will instantly contact any empires whose sensors reach them. Once revealed, organic fallen empires typically have a Dismissive attitude towards normal empires, and do not accept trades or envoys. They always start with their borders closed, but some fallen empires open them and accept trades if relations improve sufficiently to change their attitude to Patronizing.

Fallen empires will gain a stacking −10 opinion penalty towards empires who manage to research technologies associated with them - those being reverse-engineered Dark Matter components, the technologies obtained from the Enigmatic Fortress , and fallen empire buildings and ships obtained through Enigmatic Engineering or the Cosmogenesis crisis tree, unless said empire is a Scion subject with the Scion origin (scions brought into fold still get the penalty). This opinion penalty is doubled for the Keepers of Knowledge.

| Odds | Gift | |
|---|---|---|
| Before mid-game year | After mid-game year | |
| **50%** | - 1500 Minerals<br>- 500 Energy<br>- 250 Alloys | - 3000 Minerals<br>- 1000 Energy<br>- 500 Alloys |
| **20%** | +25% Research from Jobs for 10 years | |
| **15%** | One of the following rare technologies, in this order:<br>1. **Planetary Shields**<br>2. **Synchronized Defenses**<br>3. **Selected Lineages**<br>4. **Corps of Engineers**<br>5. **Gene Banks**<br>If all these technologies are researched:<br>- +25% Research from Jobs for 10 years | |
| **10%** | - 3000 Minerals<br>- 1000 Energy<br>- 500 Alloys | 3 escorts |
| **5%** | 1 battlecruiser | |

Dormant fallen empires have a number of potential interactions with regular empires. Some of these happen randomly, while others occur based on certain conditions.

**Requests** are one-time events that have a drawback in exchange for an increased chance of receiving gifts. Accepting a request grants a decaying +100 opinion while refusing gives a decaying −50 opinion. Requests are not available if at war or the empire is Genocidal.

**Tasks** are missions to go to war against another empire within 20 years to fulfill the goals of a Fallen Empire in exchange for greatly increased opinion and an increased chance of receiving gifts. Only rival empires can be picked as targets. Tasks can only be given to player empires. Fulfilling a task grants a decaying +100 opinion while refusing gives a minor −25 opinion. However, failing the task by not completing it in time gives greater opinion penalties. If the target empire is destroyed or changes policy on its own, the task is canceled without any effect on opinion. Tasks are not available if at war or if the empire is Genocidal.

**Demands** are ultimatums from Fallen Empires if their opinion drops below −100 . Submitting improves opinion by +25 but rejecting the demands grants the Fallen Empire the Punishment casus belli. If accepted, the effects are identical to losing the war about these goals, except the ruler is not executed. If the Fallen Empire was rivaled by the offending empire, they do not make any demands at all and will simply declare war from the start. AI empires accept demands 90% of the time unless their fleet power is above 300k, in which case the demand is refused. If any Fallen Empire has lost a war or any of its original owned planets have been conquered in a war, all Fallen Empires will stop making demands regardless of opinion. Fallen Empires never declare war on subjects or an empire if their own power is pathetic compared to it (or its overlord). They do not, however, consider the power of empires that have a defence pact or federation with their wargoal target when deciding whether to declare war.

**Gifts** are sent by some Fallen Empires to empires that accepted a request, completed a task, or the Fallen Empire is Patronizing towards. Gifts are always positive and have no drawbacks. Accepting a gift also grants a decaying +50 opinion while refusing it gives a decaying −50 opinion. To be tagged as a gift recipient, the empire must have less than 100k fleet power and not be at war.

The mean time between gifts is 100 years, modified by the following:

- ×2 if attitude is neither Patronizing nor Enigmatic, and either accepted or fulfilled a task
- ×0.25 if Enigmatic attitude and accepted a task
- ×0.1 if Enigmatic attitude and completed a task
- ×0.5 if Patronizing attitude and accepted a task
- ×0.25 if Patronizing attitude and completed a task
- ×0.75 if Opinion 75
- ×0.75 if Opinion 100
- ×0.75 if Opinion 150
- ×0.75 if Opinion 200

### Scion interactions

Empires with the Scion origin start as the Scion subject of either the Holy Guardians or the Keepers of Knowledge, and their home system has a Wormhole that links to their overlord. If there are no Fallen Empires when the game starts, a Fallen Empire with a single system is spawned in the galaxy to act as their overlord.

Scions are obligated to join their overlord's wars, both defensive and offensive. The overlord does not join wars the scion is involved in, but should the Scion find themselves losing a war against a superior empire, the overlord gifts them with a temporary fleet of Fallen Empire ships for 20 years. Scions can use the Bring Into Fold casus belli against other empires in order to turn them into fellow scions, sharing the same overlord. These forced scions do not receive any of the benefits of being a scion, other than the subject terms. Scions are free to expand and conduct diplomacy without any restrictions, and they are not subject to any resource contribution to or from their overlord. Like other subjects, Scions can declare war on their overlord and wage an independence war to become free, although this will require facing and overcoming the overlord fallen empire's technological might.

Scions receive one of the gifts in the table to the right every 25 to 50 years:

| Odds | Scion gift |
|---|---|
| **16.7%** | One of the following<br>Engineering technologies, in this order:<br>1. Holographic Casts<br>2. Advanced Mineral Purification<br>3. **Corps of Engineers**<br>4. Battleships<br>5. **Improved Titan Hulls** |
| **16.7%** | One of the following<br>Physics technologies, in this order:<br>1. Miniature Containment Fields<br>2. Self-Evolving Logic<br>3. Antimatter Power<br>4. **Autonomous Ship Intellects**<br>5. **Jump Drive** |
| **16.7%** | One of the following<br>Society technologies, in this order:<br>1. Eco Simulation<br>2. Xenobiology<br>3. Foreign Soil Enrichment<br>4. Climate Restoration<br>5. **Ascension Theory** |
| **25%** | 3000, 4000, or 5000 Alloys |
| **25%** | 3000, 4000, or 5000 Consumer Goods |

Scions and their overlord also have the following special interactions, checked once per year. Each interaction can occur only once.

| Interaction | Weight |
|---|---|
| Level 5 or higher leader is requested No penalty for refusing | 10 |
| Level 7 Fallen Empire leader is offered No penalty for refusing | 10 30 if a leader has been requested |
| 1 battlecruiser and 3 escorts | 10 |
| Add tech progress on next hyperdrive technology Not available until 25 years have passed | 10 50 if Eager Explorers or variant or more than 75 years have passed and hasn't researched Hyperlane Breach Points |
| Offers resources to construct colony ship No penalty for refusing | 10 50 if more than 50 years have passed and has colonized fewer than 3 planets, including the capital |
| No interaction Repeatable | 500 250 if no interaction has occurred and less than 50 years have passed |

Scion gifts and interactions are in addition to the normal gifts and interactions by fallen empires.

Empires starting with a Scion origin and Holy Guardians as their overlord have enough opinion to colonize all Holy Worlds without getting demands to abandon them; they will still take an opinion malus, but it will be overcome by the opinion bonus of being a Scion. So long as the Scion keeps their opinion positive, the overlord will not demand them leave the planets. Such empires also have their own version of the message displayed when they survey a Holy World.

Scions will not incur any opinion penalties with their overlords from obtaining Fallen Empire-related technologies , but they will still incur opinion penalties with other existing fallen empires.

## Awakened empires

If sufficiently provoked, a dormant empire might become an Awakened Empire. Awakened Empires stop being passive and make a bid to dominate the galaxy or defend it from a Crisis, depending on the mode of Awakening. Awakened Empires have considerable technological and starting resource advantages even compared to mid- or late-game empires, and thus their awakening can have drastic consequences for the galaxy's balance of power but can also make them one of the best guardian forces in the galaxy.

When a fallen empire awakens, the following this will happen to it:

- Their civics are replaced with Revanchist Fervor and Ancient Caches of Technology, allowing them to expand and build ships without restrictions.
- Their resource storages are filled.
- They establish communications with all empires in the galaxy.
- They instantly receive an additional fleet (8 Battlecruisers, 18 Escorts).
 - They receive a second additional fleet, if a default empire has more than 120k fleet power, more than 150K federation fleet power, or more than 75K fleet power and a defensive pact partner with more than 75K fleet power
 - They receive a third additional fleet, if a default empire has more than 200k fleet power, more than 200K federation fleet power, or more than 120K fleet power and a defensive pact partner with more than 120K fleet power

- The reinforcement event available for dormant empires can no longer trigger.

Awakened Empires use regular diplomatic stances and may pick Supremacist. Upon awakening, a Fallen Empire's entry in the Contacts list is updated with a new name and is placed in the "Others" section instead of "Fallen Empires".

Every empire has the Containment casus belli towards awakened empires, which allows them to start a total war against them with the End Threat wargoal.

### Decadence

Decadence is a penalty that starts to affect Awakened Empires 20 years after they awakened, preventing them from establishing a permanent hegemony over other empires, as well as representing their arrogant hubris. It has a 0.5% chance to increase each month for each planet the Awakened Empire and its subjects possess, giving the following penalties to the Awakened Empire, representing how their apparent success has blinded them:

- −1.32% Resources from Jobs (max −66% )
- −0.5% Ship Weapons Damage (max −25% )
- −0.5% Ship Health, Armor and Shields (max −25% )
- +2% Subject opinion penalty for having less relative power than all of them combined (max +100% )
- −1.6% Intelligence Encryption Strength (max −80% )

### Upstart awakening

The default type of awakening, an upstart awakening, usually happens if a standard empire becomes militarily too strong in fleet power or has managed to conquer a fallen empire world. In this case, the fallen empire decides that the young empires are becoming too powerful and thus set out to impose their primacy on them. The requirements are as following:

- The game has reached the end game year, the Fallen Empire is not at war, and its total fleet power is above 60K.
- A default empire is getting too strong (above 70K total fleet power, or above 60K fleet power and above 90K federation fleet power) or has conquered a Fallen Empire world.
- No other Fallen Empire has already awakened.
- The event has a mean time to happen of 50 years, modified as follows:
 - ×0.5 if a default empire has more than 120K total fleet power.
 - ×0.1 if a default empire owns a formerly Fallen Empire-controlled world.
 - ×1.5 if there are two fallen empires; ×2 if there are three; ×2.5 if there are 4 or more. This offsets the increased chance for one of them to awaken due to more fallen empires each checking the event.

When using standard game settings, the fleet power requirement for an upstart awakening usually tends to be easily fulfilled towards the late- and endgame. As such, it is likely for an upstart awakening to happen eventually, if no other awakenings are triggered before that.

The Awakened Empire has imperious attitude towards any neighbor empires and sends a request for those empires to become their unique subject type . Refusing the request adds −200 opinion from the Awakened Empire and causes them to declare war shortly afterwards.

If an Awakened Empire exists in the galaxy, the Galactic Community sees it as crisis, strengthening support for a Galactic Custodian, or even a Galactic Emperor. Resolutions to nominate or strengthen a custodian gain much higher support from all empires, except those that never would vote for a given resolution.

#### War in Heaven

The War in Heaven is a special event where a second fallen empire awakens as well, and the two awakened empires eventually launch a Total War against one another with the normal empires acting as satellite states in their conflict. Once the first fallen empire awakens, an ancient rival may be chosen with the following chances:

- 40% A fallen empire with the opposite ethic is picked as rival, if one exists.
- 20% A fallen empire with a random ethic is picked as rival. This can hit the opposing ethic by chance. Ancient Caretakers cannot be picked.
- 40% No rival is picked, and thus no War in Heaven can happen.

That can only happen onece per game and the notification that an ancient rival exists appears within a decade after the awakening.

For the second fallen empire to awaken, it must also meet the same requirements as the first one (not at war, fleet power above 60K, has not already awakened some other way). If the requirements are met, there is a 50% chance for the second Fallen Empire to awaken within a decade.

Once the second empire is awakened, the two awakened empires will go to war in ~3 years with the War in Heaven wargoal, which causes a Total War. They each spawn an additional fleet, and a second one if any default empire has above 70K Fleet Power. The War in Heaven can also end with a status quo due to War Exhaustion, which will leave the galaxy with two awakened empires and resume after their borders reach each other. If the Galactic Community exists, a resolution to ban joining one or both sides becomes available.

When the War in Heaven starts, each regular empire that is not involved in a war is presented with the choice to join either side or stay neutral. There are five options:

- Join the first Awakened Empire
- Join the second Awakened Empire
- Pick neither side (This will make one eligible to lead or join the League of Non-Aligned Powers)
- Subject empires always follow their overlord
- Members of the Galactic Imperium always follow the emperor

Choices and AI weighting:

- AI empires that border an Awakened Empire will always side with it
- AI empires with less than 20K fleet power and no federation will side with an Awakened Empire based on their ethics
- AI empires with more than 20K fleet power or that are part of a federation with a human player stay neutral
- AI empires with less than 20K fleet power that are part of an AI federation pick at random
- Genocidal and crisis level 4 or 5 empires never pick a side

Empires that side with one of the awakened empires become its subject and join the war on the overlord's side.

Once one of the Awakened Empires is defeated, vassals of the winning side that contributed to the war receive planets from the losing side's members unless they are too far from the borders. The League of Non-Aligned Powers still has to fight the remaining Awakened Empire.

**League of Non-Aligned Powers**

Shortly after the War in Heaven starts, the League of Non-Aligned Powers, a federation for empires wishing to remain independent, may form, which proceeds as follows:

First, a federation president is selected from amongst the normal empires present (that picked neither side), in the following order:

1. The Galactic Custodian
2. Federation presidents, sorted by relative fleet power (including federation fleets)
3. Independent empires, sorted by relative fleet power (including subjects' fleets)

After a president has been picked, if said president already leads a federation, that federation will be renamed to the League of Non-Aligned Powers. Otherwise, a level 3 Galactic Union federation with the said name will be created, even if the chosen president does not have The Federation tradition. When the federation is created, all independent empires, including those that declined leadership before, are offered one chance to join the federation, which will add them as a member outright upon acceptance. After that, joining the federation must be done through regular diplomacy. Once prospective members have joined, a state of war will be declared between the League of Non-Aligned Powers and both Awakened Empires.

Empires that are at war with an awakened empire, Genocidal, or have the Galactic Nemesis ascension perk cannot lead or join the League of Non-Aligned Powers. If an AI empire is offered to form the League of Non-Aligned Powers there is a 99% chance for it to accept. When the League of Non-Aligned Powers is created, empires that chose to remain neutral at the start of the War in Heaven will always join it.

Members of the League of Non-Aligned Powers get a temporary +200 opinion to and from each other, which lasts until the War in Heaven has ended. Once the War in Heaven has ended, the League of Non-Aligned Powers will gain a −5 Cohesion penalty.

Because the League of Non-Aligned Powers will be at war with both Awakened Empires, they can only achieve victory by conquering both said empires. If a player empire was selected to lead the League of Non-Aligned Powers, they will be awarded the Last, Best Hope achievement once both awakened empires are defeated.

If the Galactic Imperium exists, it will assume the role of the league, gain 100 Imperial Authority, and the awakened empires will declare war against the Galactic Emperor, with all member empires joining the war in defense of the Galactic Imperium.

### Guardians of the Galaxy

When an endgame crisis (including player crises ) or the Gray Tempest occurs, a Fallen Empire can awaken after 5 years with the declared goal of ending said crisis. When awakened as Guardians of the Galaxy, a fallen empire will always agree to form or join a Federation, no matter what opinion they hold. Once the Crisis has been defeated, the Guardian empire leaves the current Federation and becomes a regular awakened empire. The chances for a Guardian Awakening are the following:

- 60% chance either the Enigmatic Observers, Keepers of Knowledge or War Splinter awaken.
- 15% chance all viable Guardians awaken.
- 25% chance neither Fallen Empire awakens.

Once awakened, the Guardian empire experiences the full set of awakening effects, and all empires are notified. All AI empires get one of the following opinion bonuses towards the Awakened Empire (equal chances):

- +100 Opinion
- +50 Opinion
- No modifier

Only the Enigmatic Observers, Keepers of Knowledge and War Splinter can become the Guardians. If they awakened before, they will immediately become Guardians unless they're in the middle of an ongoing War in Heaven. The Holy Guardians, Militant Isolationists or other Shattered Fragments will never awaken as or become Guardians, while the Ancient Caretakers will only become Guardians against the Contingency crisis. Guardian awakenings do not roll for Ancient Rival, and thus will not take part in the War in Heaven.

Each time an empire researches the Applied Infinity Thesis technology, there is a 1% chance to trigger a Guardians of the Galaxy awakening. This type of awakening can take place regardless of existing awakenings or the game year.

## Types of fallen empires

### Enigmatic Observers

The Enigmatic Observers are a Fanatic Xenophile empire. Their founder species has 5 more trait points than regular empires and they have a servant species with the Mechanical, Domestic Protocols and Luxurious traits. They use Gene Warrior Armies. The Enigmatic Observers cannot be angered except by insults and rivalry but if they are angered their demand and wargoal will be for the targeted empire to outlaw purges. Reaching Patronizing attitude with them will lead to open borders. Upon awakening, they will be renamed Benevolent Interventionists .

The Enigmatic Observers can send tasks to other empires and have the following possible requests:

- Send 100 pops to The Preserve.
- Force a rival to outlaw Purges.
- Give the brain scans from the Limbo event chain. This will cause the Awoken species to be added to the Preserve.

If an empire causes the extinction of the Tiyanki by destroying their last fleet, it will gain a temporary −100 Opinion with the Enigmatic Observers.

The Enigmatic Observers home system contains 3 Gaia Worlds: Cradle (size 20), Mother (size 12) and Brother (size 10). An adjacent system will contain The Preserve, a size 20 Gaia World protected by a deep space citadel that houses 3-5 species and can gain additional species via requests to other empires.

The Enigmatic Observers use the following ship designs:

| Paradox titan | Enigma battlecruiser | Riddle escort | Deep space citadel | Defense platform | Colossus |

### Militant Isolationists

The Militant Isolationists are a Fanatic Xenophobe empire. Their founder species has 3 more trait points than regular empires and they have a servant species with the Nerve Stapled, Charismatic and Strong traits. They use Xenomorph Armies. The Militant Isolationists are angered if a starbase is built in a system that has a hyperlane connection to their borders and if they are angered, their demand and wargoal will be for the said starbases to be dismantled. They will never send tasks or requests to other empires, and will never open borders under any circumstances. Upon awakening, they will be renamed Jingoistic Reclaimers .

The Militant Isolationists home system contains 2 Gaia Worlds: The Core (size 25), and its moon Boundary (size 12). Three adjacent systems will contain a shielded world and deep space citadel each. Surveying them will bring the option to issue a special project that requires a science ship and takes 2 years. When the special project is completed one of the following will happen:

- 4 Void Clouds emerge.
- Gain a fleet of 6 Riddle Escorts and 4 Enigma Battlecruisers.
- Gain a large amount of scaled Engineering Research. This outcome cannot happen for Gestalt Consciousness empires.
- Option to recruit the renowned paragon Tuborek . This outcome can only happen once.

The Shallash unique system can only spawn next to the borders of the Militant Isolationists.

The Militant Isolationists use the following ship designs:

Fallen Empires created by a Cosmogenesis empire achieving victory will default to being Militant Isolationists if none of its ethics, fanatic or otherwise, match those required to be a different Fallen Empire.

### Holy Guardians

The Holy Guardians are a Fanatic Spiritualist empire. Their founder species has 3 more trait points than regular empires and the Psionic trait. They use Psionic Armies. If they are angered their demand and wargoal will be to decolonize Holy Worlds, or if none are colonized then to outlaw AI. They can send tasks to other empires and have only one possible request: changing the Artificial Intelligence policy to Outlawed. They will never open borders under any circumstances, even towards original Scion subjects. Upon awakening, they will be renamed Doctrinal Enforcers .

The Holy Guardians home system contains 2 Gaia Worlds: Celestial Throne (size 30) and Sky Temple (size 22), which contains the Phased Empyrean Shrine unique building. The system also contains 2 deep space citadels.

If they awaken as the Doctrinal Enforcers and defeat a Fallen or Awakened Empire in war, they will change that empire's ethics to Fanatic Spiritualist, causing the defeated empire to become a Holy Guardians dormant fallen empire, albeit with no Holy worlds.

The Holy Guardians use the following ship designs:

| Paradox titan | Enigma battlecruiser | Riddle escort | Deep space citadel | Defense platform | Colossus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Psi Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Tachyon Sensors, Precognitive Interface (Artillery), Perdition Beam, Perdition Beam, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Advanced Shield Hardener, Advanced Shield Hardener, Advanced Shield Hardener, Shield Capacitor | Psi Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Tachyon Sensors, Precognitive Interface (Line), Focused Arc Emitter, Focused Arc Emitter, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Neutron Launchers, Neutron Launchers, Devastator Torpedoes, Devastator Torpedoes, Medium Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Advanced Shield Hardener, Advanced Shield Hardener, Shield Capacitor | Psi Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Tachyon Sensors, Precognitive Interface (Picket), Devastator Torpedoes, Devastator Torpedoes, Devastator Torpedoes, Small Plasma Cannon, Small Plasma Cannon, Small Plasma Cannon, Small Plasma Cannon, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Medium Psionic Shield, Medium Psionic Shield, Medium Psionic Shield, Medium Neutronium Armor, Medium Neutronium Armor, Medium Neutronium Armor, Advanced Shield Hardener, Shield Capacitor | Dark Matter Reactor, Tachyon Sensors, FTL Inhibitor, Strike Command, Focused Arc Emitter, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Advanced Shield Hardener, Advanced Shield Hardener, Advanced Shield Hardener | Dark Matter Reactor, Tachyon Sensors, Precognitive Interface (Platform), Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Medium Plasma Cannon, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Shield Capacitor, Shield Capacitor | Psi Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Colossus Combat Computer, Neutron Sweep, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Psionic Shield, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor |

#### Holy worlds

Four randomly chosen unowned systems near the borders of the Holy Guardians will each have a Gaia Worlds with the Holy World modifier, a golden aura, no blockers, and preset names.

- Pristine Jewel is size 10
- Emerald Mausoleum is size 14
- Walled Garden is size 18
- Prophet's Retreat is size 25

When an empire surveys a Holy World, they receive a message informing them about its presence and an option to gain either 6x unity output ( 100~100 000 ) or 6x influence output ( 40~100 ) depending on diplomatic stance and ethics. Starbases may be build without consequence and if an empire with the Consecrated Worlds ascension perk uses the Consecrate World decision on one of Holy Worlds, it gives +30 opinion with the Holy Guardians for each planet consecrated. This opinion bonus is cumulative, but deconsecrating any Holy World removes the entire opinion bonus until this is reversed.

Any empire that colonizes a Holy World will immediately suffer a −200 opinion penalty with the Holy Guardians. If their opinion of the colonizer of any Holy World is low enough to send demands, they instantly send a demand to abandon colonization. If the demand is accepted, all colonies on Holy Worlds are removed alongside the opinion penalty, but if it is rejected, then the Holy Guardians' opinion about the colonizer will decrease further, while granting them the Punishment casus belli with the Cleanse Holy Worlds wargoal.

If an empire shields, terraforms or destroys a Holy World with regular terraforming, a Colossus, Star-Eater, or the Consume World situation and the Holy Guardians are present in the galaxy, they will immediately awaken and declare a war of subjugation. This type of awakening can take place regardless of existing awakenings or the game year and can trigger, when the conditions are met, a rivalry with another fallen empire (thereby leading to War in Heaven). Aside from the war against the defiler, the Doctrinal Enforcers will act like normally awakened empires and try to dominate the galaxy.

Somewhat hypocritically, once the Holy Guardians awaken as the Doctrinal Enforcers, they will freely colonize their own Holy Worlds.

Multiple achievements involve the Holy Worlds:

- Colonizing all four Holy Worlds awards the Deus Vult achievement.
- Using a Deluge Machine Colossus on an owned Holy World awards the Holy Water achievement.
- Terraforming an owned Holy World into a Volcanic World awards the Burning Heaven achievement.

If an empire obtains the Head of Zarqlan relic, it can colonize the Holy Worlds without incurring opinion penalties from the Holy Guardians. The Holy Guardians inform the empire of this shortly after the relic is obtained. If the Holy Guardians awaken as Doctrinal Enforcers, the relic will allow the empire to refuse subjugation without risking war.

### Keepers of Knowledge

The Keepers of Knowledge are a Fanatic Materialist empire. Their founder species has 3 more trait points than regular empires and the Cybernetic trait. They have a servant species with the Mechanical, Domestic Protocols and Luxurious traits. They use Robotic Armies. The Keepers of Knowledge cannot be angered except by insults and rivalry but if they are angered their demand and wargoal will be humiliation. They can send tasks to other empires and have only one possible request: giving them a Scientist of level 5 or higher. Reaching Patronizing attitude with them will lead to open borders. Upon awakening, they will be renamed Watchful Regulators . If The Machine Age is enabled, the Keepers of Knowledge will always use a cybernetic portrait .

The Keepers of Knowledge capital is Font of Knowledge, a size 20 Ecumenopolis. An adjacent system will contain The Archives, a size 15 Gaia World that has the Master Archive unique building and is protected by a deep space citadel.

The Keepers of Knowledge use the following ship designs:

| Paradox titan | Enigma battlecruiser | Riddle escort | Deep space citadel | Defense platform | Colossus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Tachyon Sensors, Sapient Combat Computer (Artillery), Perdition Beam, Perdition Beam, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Shield Hardener, Shield Hardener, Living Reactive Armor, Shield Capacitor | Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Tachyon Sensors, Sapient Combat Computer (Line), Tachyon Lance, Tachyon Lance, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Shield Hardener, Shield Capacitor, Shield Capacitor | Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Tachyon Sensors, Sapient Combat Computer (Picket), Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Small Phased Disruptor, Small Phased Disruptor, Small Phased Disruptor, Small Phased Disruptor, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Medium Dark Matter Deflectors, Medium Dark Matter Deflectors, Medium Dark Matter Deflectors, Medium Neutronium Armor, Medium Neutronium Armor, Medium Neutronium Armor, Shield Hardener, Shield Capacitor | Dark Matter Reactor, Tachyon Sensors, FTL Inhibitor, Strike Command, Tachyon Lance, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Living Reactive Armor, Living Reactive Armor, Living Reactive Armor | Dark Matter Reactor, Tachyon Sensors, Sapient Combat Computer (Platform), Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Shield Capacitor, Shield Capacitor | Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Colossus Combat Computer, Global Pacifier, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor |

The first time a Cosmogenesis empire researches the Applied Infinity Thesis technology and while the Keepers of Knowledge are present in galaxy, the fallen empire will demand them to accept a modifier of −10% Research Speed and −25% Advanced Logic from Jobs for 20 years or lose −75 Opinion with the Keepers of Knowledge.

### Ancient Caretakers

The Ancient Caretakers are a Machine Intelligence empire. Their founder species has 3 more trait points than regular empires and Ring World Preference. Unlike biological fallen empires they have the Fallen Machine Intelligence and Custodian Matrix civics and their ships have a different texture featuring integrated circuit patterns. Upon awakening, they will be renamed either Galactic Custodians or Rampaging Machines , depending of the type of awakening.

The Ancient Caretakers do not have an opinion of any empire and are completely unpredictable. Their attitude uniquely displays as Enigmatic . They may offer gifts or open their borders for no reason or request assistance with tasks that can give a permanent bonus or a temporary but serious penalty. Ancient Caretakers cannot be angered and do not declare wars but they can be declared war upon. Insulting or rivalling them has no effect on their opinion and they will never participate in a War in Heaven.

The Ancient Caretakers can send the following requests to other empires:

- Machine Intelligence with at least 1100 pops may be asked to give 200 pops to the Ancient Caretakers. This request has a mean time to happen of 50 years.
- Biological empires may be asked to allow inoculations while machine empires may be asked to allow code changes. A negative modifier is applied for 10 years. Afterwards the results appear and can be either positive or negative. This request has a mean time to happen of 100 years and cannot be offered to empires with the Wilderness origin.

| Request | Initial modifier | Incompatible outcome (10 years) | Compatible outcome (permanent) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inoculations** | - −5% Happiness if not Xenophobe<br>- −10% Happiness if Xenophobe | - −20% Happiness<br>- −10% Pop growth speed<br>- −10 years Leader lifespan | - +5% Pop growth speed<br>- +10 years Leader lifespan |
| **Code changes** | +10% Robot upkeep | - +5% Robot upkeep<br>- −20% Robot resource output | +5% Robot resource output |

The Ancient Caretakers can send the following tasks to other empires:

- **Attack other Empire:** With a mean time to happen of 100 years, an empire is asked to attack a fellow empire. Unlike other tasks, this one can target empires that refused requests or tasks from the Ancient Caretakers. The time for the attack is 20 years, with up to 1 year overtime.
- **Colonize a planet:** With a mean time to happen of 200 years, the Custodians request the colonization of a planet. The planet is always near or inside the empire's borders and eligible for colonization when the request is given. Within 20 years, at least 500 grown pops must be on the colonized planet. Care should be taken if the habitable worlds setting was raised because this task does not add a point of interest on the galaxy map.
- **Stop waging war:** With a mean time to happen of 100 years, the empire is tasked to set the War Philosophy policy to Defensive Wars within 20 years. Empires that already do are excluded.
- **Stop colonizing:** With a mean time to happen of 100 years, the empire is tasked with not colonizing any world for 10 years. This task can not appear after 100 years have passed. Empires with planets under colonization are excluded.

The Ancient Caretakers will always have five systems. Their home system contains 3 intact Ring World sections, with the capital having the Ancient Cryo-Chamber unique building, a repairable segment, and three deep space citadels. Two adjacent systems have a repairable ringworld each. The other two systems contain nothing but debris and the starbase.

The Ancient Caretakers use the following ship designs:

| Paradox titan | Enigma battlecruiser | Riddle escort | Deep space citadel | Defense platform | Colossus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Tachyon Sensors, Sapient Combat Computer (Artillery), Ancient Ruination Glare, Perdition Beam, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Shield Hardener, Shield Hardener, Living Reactive Armor, Shield Capacitor | Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Tachyon Sensors, Sapient Combat Computer (Line), Tachyon Lance, Tachyon Lance, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Shield Hardener, Shield Hardener, Auxiliary Fire Control | Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Tachyon Sensors, Sapient Combat Computer (Picket), Large Plasma Cannon, Large Plasma Cannon, Small Plasma Cannon, Small Plasma Cannon, Small Plasma Cannon, Small Plasma Cannon, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Medium Dark Matter Deflectors, Medium Dark Matter Deflectors, Medium Dark Matter Deflectors, Medium Neutronium Armor, Medium Neutronium Armor, Medium Neutronium Armor, Shield Hardener, Shield Capacitor | Dark Matter Reactor, Tachyon Sensors, FTL Inhibitor, Strike Command, Tachyon Lance, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Advanced Strike Craft, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Shield Capacitor, Shield Capacitor, Shield Capacitor | Dark Matter Reactor, Tachyon Sensors, Sapient Combat Computer (Platform), Large Gamma Laser, Large Gamma Laser, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Medium Phased Disruptor, Guardian Point-Defense, Guardian Point-Defense, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Shield Capacitor, Shield Capacitor | Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Colossus Combat Computer, Neutron Sweep, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Dark Matter Deflectors, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor, Large Neutronium Armor |

#### Contingency crisis awakening

The Ancient Caretakers can only awaken as Guardians for the Contingency crisis, doing so right after the sterilization hubs come online. This happens independently from the Guardian awakening mechanics, making it possible for up to three Fallen Empires to awaken as Guardians. Unlike other Guardian Fallen Empires, the Ancient Caretakers will never form or join a federation.

### Shattered Fragments

The Shattered Fragments are three Hive Mind empires in a Federation with each other. All three have the same founder species, which has 5 more trait points than regular empires and Hive World Preference. All three empires have the Fragmented Command civic. Reaching Patronizing attitude will lead to open borders, but relations are not shared between Splinters. If they are angered, their demand and wargoal will be humiliation.

| Splinter | Second civic | Capital system (size) | Second system (size) | Third system (size) | Ships | Tasks & requests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Control** | Stunted Drones | Harvester 001 (25) Harvester 002 (28) | Harvester 71 (20) | | Weavers | - Give them 100 founder species pops. A year later, a data packet will be offered. Accepting it has a 50% chance of unlocking the construction of one Fallen Empire building and a 50% chance of giving −50 Opinion with the Control Splinter.<br>- Dismantle a starbase within a year and do not rebuild it for 5 years. Systems with a colony or wormhole and Terminal Egress cannot be picked. This task in only available if the empire has a starbase in a system that is connected to two unowned systems and not also connected to two owned systems. The task will also be completed if another empire conquers the system. This task cannot be given during the first 20 years.<br>- Make a Galactic Community resolution pass/fail. Only the 5 Galactic Community members with the highest Diplomatic Weight can receive this task. For the duration of the task, the empire will receive +50% Diplomatic Weight when supporting/opposing resolutions. |
| **Growth** | Unstable Drones | Slumbering Creche (30) Abeyant Nidus (22) Dormant Nursery (7) | Dozing Tiller (20) Terraforming Candidate (22) Terraforming Candidate (16) | Terraforming Candidate (16) | Weavers Harbingers | - A biological species gains a random phenotype trait. 3 random phenotype options will be available. Only empires that have biological pops can receive this request. Empires with the Evolutionary Predators origin will instead gain progress for the Adaptive Evolution situation.<br>- Give the founder species of the Shattered Fragments empires an origin, leviathan or nucleotide isolation trait. Only empires that have a biological species with one of those traits can receive this request.<br>- Allow the Fallen Empire to experiment with a planet. Only empires that have at least 2 planets with 1000+ pops can receive this request. A year later, the planet will gain one of the following:<br>  - Radio Bugs modifier<br>  - World Alight modifier<br>  - 500 pops from 4 randomly-generated species |
| **War** | Hyper-Aggressive Drones | Redoubt (30) 2 Deep Space Citadels | Chance of Glory (27) Trial of Survival (25) | Ruined Interstellar Assembly 3 Deep Space Citadels | Weavers Maulers | - A hostile ship appears within borders and must be defeated within a year. The first time the task is received, the ship will be an Elder Mauler. The second time the task is received, the ship will be an Elder Harbinger.<br>- Win a war against an independent neighbor within 10 years. Empires with equivalent relative power will be picked first. Empires with a Truce are twice more likely to be picked and the Truce will be removed. Empires with a Non-Aggression Pact, Defensive Pact or Federation or branch offices on their worlds cannot be picked.<br>- Do not declare war for 10 years. |

All three Shattered Fragments have their capital connected to a central unowned system called Last Thought. The system contains an Infested World with the **The Last Thought** archaeological site . It also contains a number of neutral fleets: mixed Amoeba and Tiyanki fleets, two Sky Dragon guardians, and a Toxic Entity. If Grand Archive is installed, it will also contain a fleet with Cutholoids and Voidworms. The first time an empire's ships enters the system, the Shattered Fragments will demand that the fleet leave immediately; accepting causes the fleet to go MIA. In subsequent attempts, the Shattered Fragments will also demand humiliation. Refusing to leave the system at any point gives a −200 opinion penalty with all Shattered Fragments empires. This will not happen if the ships are cloaked.

Unlike other Fallen Empires, the Shattered Fragments use a special version of the biological shipset, made up of **Cypher Maulers** , **Quandary Weavers** , **Maze Harbingers** and **Cryptic Stingers** . These are effectively a more powerful counterpart to regular biological ships and use similar mechanics to them. Conventional empires using a biological shipset who advance through the Cosmogenesis crisis tree will be able to unlock these ships, as opposed to the mechanical ships used by other Fallen Empire types.

Only one of the Shattered Fragments can awaken, which will cause it to annex the other two Shattered Fragments and merge into a single empire named Fused Ascendancy , in addition to gaining control of all fleets in Last Thought. The federation they were part of is disbanded. All three Shattered Fragments can have an upstart awakening but the War Splinter can also awaken as Guardian of the Galaxy. In an upstart awakening, the empire with the most tasks completed for it will awaken, or a random one in case of a tie. If the Growth Splinter awakens, it will also gain the Devouring Swarm civic. If the Control Splinter awakens, it will create or join the Galactic Community, unlock Galactic Council, Custodian and Galactic Imperium resolutions even if the required DLCs are not installed, and if any of its resolutions is vetoed it will declare a war of subjugation on the vetoing empire. In a Guardian awakening, the War Splinter will always awaken and annex the other two regardless of the number of completed tasks.

## Empire names

Fallen empires typically use empire names different from that of regular empires, usually ones hinting at either their age, their perceived duty or that they once were much more powerful and widespread than they currently are. Post-Cosmogenesis fallen empires will not use these names.

| Type | Keepers of Knowledge | Holy Guardians | Enigmatic Observers | Militant Isolationists | Ancient Caretakers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dormant | - Archivists<br>- Chroniclers<br>- Conservers | - Guardians<br>- Protectors<br>- Watchers | - Ancients<br>- Forerunners<br>- Progenitors | - Remnant<br>- Shard<br>- Vestige | - Continuance<br>- Continuity<br>- Continuum |
| Awakened | - Directors<br>- Enforcers<br>- Regulators | - Crusaders<br>- Fanatics<br>- Zealots | - Arbitrators<br>- Mediators<br>- Peacekeepers | - Reclaimers<br>- Reconquerors<br>- Restorers | - Custodian Process<br>- Defense Protocol<br>- Final Directive |

Additionally, fallen empires will use the following names for their ship classes (post-cosmogenesis empires will not use them):

| Empire name | Paradox titan | Enigma battlecruiser | Riddle escort | Deep space citadel | Defense platform | Colossus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ancient Caretakers | - Alpha-class | - Beta-class | - Gamma-class | - Citadel | - Sigma-class | - Omega-class |
| Enigmatic Observers | - Keeper-class | - Custodian-class | - Overseer-class | - Citadel | - Watcher-class | - Adjuster-class |
| Militant Isolationists | - Imperium-class | - Supremacy-class | - Glory-class | - Citadel | - Devastator-class | - Reaper-class |
| Holy Guardians | - Eternal-class | - Avatar-class | - Zealot-class | - Citadel | - Faith-class | - Cleanser-class |
| Keepers of Knowledge | - Savant-class | - Scholar-class | - Sage-class | - Citadel | - Cloaker-class | - Enforcer-class |

## The Synthetic Queen

Should the Synthetic Queen appear as the crisis and any fallen empires exist in the galaxy, she will spawn in the homeworld of one - preferring the Militant Isolationists over the others if they are present. She will go to war and defeat all fallen empires in the galaxy, with her ships able to cross all empire borders to attack them. The Synthetic Queen has a +200% damage bonus against fallen empires, while they have a −90% penalty against her, and she will instantly conquer fallen empire systems whenever her ships enter a fallen empire system, meaning the war will lead to the fallen empires' destruction, with Cetana gaining control of their territory and worlds. Awakened empires do not have any advantages in this war either and will likewise be annihilated. With all fallen empires gone, the War in Heaven will not be able to occur anymore, and if it has begun, then it can end rather swiftly. Regular empires are unable to interfere in this process, as during this state of the crisis, Cetana's fleets cannot be attacked

Before the Synthetic Queen declares war, Scion subjects (including ones brought into the fold later) have their subject terms changed to not join their overlord's war. However, a Scion that is part of a federation with a Guardian of the Galaxy will still be pulled into the war and be locked into Total War with an invincible Cetana (since the damage modifiers will also apply to the Scion(s)). Should Cetana appear at any point, one should immediately leave any such federation to avoid obliteration.

## Strategy

### General rules:

#### Preparations and readying up:

- The Galactic Contender Ascension Perk gives +33% Damage against Fallen Empires — dormant or awakened. If you intend to fight against Fallen Empires early, it can increase your ships' effectiveness. However, it is generally recommended to save the ascension perk slot for something more valuable if you have other means to bridge the power gap (numerous allies, endgame technologies, a large fleet etc.)
- If you have Galactic Paragons, the Inspiring Agendas tradition in Statecraft tree give access to Oppose the Fallen agenda. When prepared, it gives only +5% Damage against Fallen Empires, but when launched the bonus increases to +25% Damage and stacks with the bonus from Galactic Contender. If you plan to wage war against Fallen Empires and already have Statecraft tree (it may be not worth choosing it only for this bonus), prepare this agenda in advance to launch it and gain another damage bonus when needed.
- While it should be obvious, one should always make sure they have the basic fundamentals in order. Fully completing the Supremacy and Unyielding and Enmity Tradition trees and picking the associated Galactic Force Projection and Eternal Vigilance Ascension perks will help with militarizing your empire to meet the threat posed by Fallen Empires. Ethic-civic combinations like Fanatic Militarist and Distinguished Admiralty, which both add up to a +30% Ship Fire Rate bonus, also helps noticeably with waging war. It may seem humble and simple, but every little bit helps.
 - On the home front, civics like Mining Guilds and Relentless Industrialists (particularly on a Forge World Ecumenopolis) will help with building up a solid economic base, allowing you to field larger fleets, build more starbase defenses and more easily and swiftly replace any losses. Likewise, building Megastructures and Ecumenopolis worlds will further contribute to enhancing your economic, and by extension, military capabilities.
 - Combining the Nationalistic Zeal and Warrior Culture civics with the Interstellar Campaigns and Galactic Campaigns technologies will give you a bonus of −50% war exhaustion, which allows you to sustain wars for longer and withstand greater losses, potentially allowing you to outlast your opponents and effectively win by endurance. Fortifying your systems by building defense platforms around your upgraded Starbases and constructing Deep Space Citadels and Planetary Rings with defense modules around dedicated Fortress worlds will make your systems that much harder to capture, making attacks against you all the more costly for enemies.
 - If you wish to ratchet up your militarization even further, albeit at the cost of effectively destroying all diplomatic relations with the rest of the galaxy, then you can opt to select the Galactic Nemesis Ascension Perk as your 4th ascension perk, which will allow you to build special Menacing ships (which are built directly from minerals and both their build and upkeep costs are fixed, allowing you to mass-produce them in staggering quantities) and gain a number of very powerful empire-wide stat bonuses. Be aware, however, that doing this will require a considerable amount of preparatory groundwork (the collection of menace) to become fully effective, and said groundwork, due to its nature, comes with a considerable risk of making other empires hostile towards you. **BEWARE!** Reaching Crisis Level 5 will instantly cause the Galactic Community to declare your empire a crisis and declare war, and Fallen Empires can now even awaken as Guardians of the Galaxy against you!
 - Megastructures like the Strategic Coordination Center and Mega-Shipyard will help with enhancing your military capabilities, while the Dyson Sphere, Matter Decompressor and Arc Furnaces provide raw materials to fuel your economy.

- Selecting the Enigmatic Engineering perk as your second ascension perk will allow you to draw up to 4 fallen empire building technologies as research options, giving you an early edge. Be warned, however, that each fallen empire technology researched gives a stacking −10 opinion penalty with all fallen empires (doubled to −20 with the Keepers of Knowledge), which increases the chances of them becoming hostile toward you, so beware.
 - Continuing down on this path; selecting the Cosmogenesis Ascension perk as your 4th ascension perk, will allow you to start down on the path towards unlocking and utilizing all of the fallen empires' technologies yourself, without the need to conquer their worlds for them. As mentioned earlier, always beware the stacking opinion penalty, as this ascension perk will cause it to eventually climb high enough to make the fallen empires issue demands to you, which if refused, will lead to war.

- Diplomacy can also be leveraged as a weapon in its own right. The ethic-civic combination of Fanatic Xenophile and Diplomatic Corps alongside fully completing the Diplomacy and Politics Tradition trees (and optionally Subterfuge) will allow you to form federations to ally with other empires as well as gain enough envoys to both hold the federation together and to forge ties with other empires to either bring them into the federation as members or at least make them associates to prevent war with them. Forming a federation allows you to not only have allies to fight alongside but also enables you to build and field a Federation fleet in addition to your own fleet(s), which is very helpful against Fallen and/or Awakened Empires.
 - As for federation types, the Galactic Union is unlocked by default and works in a pinch (and is easier to hold together) while the Martial Alliance is unlocked by the Unyielding tradition tree and is more militarily capable. If you complete the Domination tradition tree, you will be able to form a Hegemony, which prevents members from freely leaving the federation, ensuring that everyone stays together when needed. Making other empires into subjects (particularly specialized ones) will further strengthen your grip and control over your allies. The Feudal Society or Franchising civics, the Shared Destiny Ascension Perk and the Intergalactic Directives resolutions will help you with retaining subjects.
 - In addition to federations, the aforementioned ethic-civic-tradition combination will also allow you to work towards gaining membership in the Galactic Council and then becoming the Galactic Custodian, the latter of which will allow you to build and field a Galactic Defense Fleet, which effectively gives you a second Federation fleet. You will also gain an increase to Diplomatic weight, allowing you to work on passing desirable Resolutions and repealing undesirable ones.

- If you have access to War Doctrines, it is generally not advised to select the Hit and Run policy, as high technology discrepancies mean that the Fallen Empire can destroy most ships nearly instantaneously, without giving them any time to disengage. For this same reason, if you have access to the No Retreat policy, selecting it provides a very good bonus ( +33% fire rate) for relatively inconsequential disadvantages; your ships are likely to end up being destroyed anyway if they attempt to flee so the inability to do so is of no concern.
- A less effective, but workable strategy also exists in making use of Mercenary Enclaves. If you are a regular empire with the Barbaric Despoilers and Warrior Culture civics or a Corporate empire with the Naval Contractors, Private Military Companies and Letters of Marque civics, you can have up to 2 and 4 Mercenary Enclaves, respectively, under your patronage, and the Lord of War Ascension Perk and Defense Privatization resolutions will allow you to have 1 and 1-2 additional enclaves under your patronage.
 - Mercenary Enclaves allow you to hire additional fleets and armies and buy certain modifiers in exchange for Energy Credits. The fleets will still occupy your naval capacity, but any casualties suffered will be replaced by the enclave.
 - If there are any Marauders in the galaxy, then their fleets can similarly be employed as mercenaries, even alongside Mercenary enclave fleets. You can even hire a Marauder commander to lead them.
 - These mercenary fleets can be used to supplement your own fleets, and you can even employ them alongside the earlier mentioned Federation fleet and Galactic Defense Fleet, to build a large, if heterodox military under your control.

- Should a Fallen Empire possess a Scion subject, they will join their overlord if war is declared on them, but not the other way around. In that case, it may be best to eliminate the Scion first to not have a war with multiple fronts. Be mindful that, should you wage war on the Scion and become superior to them, they may receive a small Fallen Empire fleet from their overlord which may be far stronger than their actual tech level, so waging war on them too early may prove unwise. Conquering the Scion's home system will also grant access to a wormhole leading straight to the overlord's own capital, which can be useful once preparations are complete but will also need to be defended.
 - Should you be a Scion yourself, then you can utilize the fact that you can receive both regular gifts and a unique set of Scion gifts from your overlord Fallen Empire alongside your empire focus tasks to quickly acquire new technologies. Your overlord will not awaken against you as long as you remain a subject and you do not need to pay them any resources, so you can use this opportunity to build up your economy and military and acquire more territory unhindered. Selecting the Enigmatic Engineering perk as your second ascension perk will allow you to draw up to 4 fallen empire building technologies as research options, giving you an early edge. Once you are sufficiently powerful, you can then declare yourself independent and break away (the Galactic Contender Ascension Perk can help you here). Should you win the subsequent independence war, you can then scan any leftover debris from your former overlord's ships to reverse-engineer their components for added benefit. For added irony, once independent, you can even select the Cosmogenesis Ascension perk to begin working towards unlocking more fallen empire technologies, which will allow you to eventually become powerful enough to conquer your former overlord's territory entirely, and effectively usurp their position of the galactic stage, both politically and technologically. The student has surpassed the master!

#### General Rules:

- Each Fallen Empire prefers a specific set of weapons tied to their ethics. Ships should be tailored to an empire's specific loadout to maximize effectiveness. While an awakened Fallen Empire can build new ships, it will never redesign them.
- Corvettes, Frigates and Destroyers are not recommended to fight Fallen Empires without a substantial numerical advantage or stat boosts. Fallen Empires field high numbers of Strike Craft and other weapons with high Tracking, which renders Evasion largely ineffective. Cruisers and Battleships however have the survivability and firepower to fight them more effectively.
 - Generally, range is your friend here, as equipping your ships with long-ranged weapons will allow them to effectively inflict damage on Fallen Empire ships from far away before they can get close enough to bring all their weapons to bear at once. Good candidates include most -slot weapons, -slot Particle Lances, Particle launchers, Arc Emitters, Macro-Batteries and Kinetic Launchers as well as Strike Craft and any type of Guided weapons with 100 range or more. The -slot Perdition Beam is also an effective weapon for attacking Fallen Empire Battlecruisers, and the Ancient Ruination Glare, if you have it and the Archaeo-Engineers Ascension Perk, is even better with greater damage but a shorter range.
 - Due to the large amount of Strike Craft that Fallen Empire ships use, you must equip your ships with adequate Flak weapons to counter this threat, as otherwise their survivability will be greatly diminished.
 - A decent start could be a combination of Spinal Mount Battleships, Artillery Battleships and Artillery Cruisers along with Broadside Battleships and Broadside Cruisers to provide raw firepower at range, supported by Hangar-Carrier Battleships and Hangar- and Torpedo Cruisers and possibly Picket Ship Destroyers to both launch Strike Craft and Guided munitions while defending the fleet against enemy equivalents.

- **Escorts** are the core of Fallen Empire fleets. They are effectively compact cruisers with extensive Point Defense that renders guided weapons all but useless (with the notable exception of Proton and Neutron Launchers), and their versatile loadouts can handle enemy ships at all combat ranges. Overall, they greatly outgun small ships available to standard empires (Corvettes, Destroyers, and Frigates) and remain a threat to larger ships (Cruisers and Battleships). However, since they are the only Fallen Empire ships that have Point Defense, this means that destroying all escorts will leave the rest of the fleet vulnerable to Guided weapons and Strike Craft. Swarmer Missiles and Nano-Missile Cloud launchers can also somewhat counteract the Escorts' point defense capabilities.
- **Battlecruisers** are far more durable than Escorts and are nearly as threatening as a player-built Titan. Battlecruisers always have two Strike Craft modules and two XL weapons alongside a sizeable array of Large and Medium weapons, making them very effective at range. They are only slightly stronger than dedicated Artillery Battleships though, as many of their extra weapons lack sufficient range to be brought to bear all at once, limiting their firepower and allowing them to be engaged from afar.
- Fallen Empire **Titans** are extremely dangerous, surpassing even Juggernauts in firepower and components, with two Titan weapons, four Strike Craft modules (four Guided weapons instead for the Holy Guardians) and a large amount of Large and Medium weapons, making them immensely powerful for their size. That being said, Dormant fallen empires will only ever have one Titan and Awakened Empire fleets will also only contain one Titan each, so this limits their threat somewhat, due to lack of numbers.
- Generally, full bypass weapons such as Disruptors and Arc Emitters are not very effective, as Fallen Empire ships each have 1-3 shield hardening components (1 on Escorts, 2 on Battlecruisers and 3 on Titans) and Titans have 1 Armor hardening component as well. Each hardening component prevents 25% of incoming penetrating damage from bypassing that defense layer, meaning that bypassing weapons will not be able to fully penetrate the shields without losing damage. Fallen Empire Titans cannot be penetrated at all, since their hardening components causes the shields to absorb 75% of all penetrating damage and the armor to absorb the remaining 25%, protecting the hull. Additionally, the multiple disengagement chances of Fallen Empire ships further hinders the effectiveness of penetrating weapons.
 - If you manage to force an engagement in a Pulsar system, then all shields will be disabled, nullifying any hardening they might have had, and allowing Penetrating weapons to become much more effective, due to the lack of armor hardening on most Fallen Empire ships. Just make sure to equip your ships with plenty of armor and -slot weapons to protect them and they should be able to achieve favorable results.

- Fallen Empires start with 10 levels of most repeatable technologies and level 10 commanders, though it is likely that the initial commanders will have died of old age by the time standard empires can seriously consider fighting them and replacement commanders do not receive special bonuses to their starting level. When awakened they will attempt to research more repeatables, but this will be very slow and essentially a non factor.
- Fallen Empire home planets are heavily fortified and require massive invasions to occupy, though even border colonies are deceptively strong due to their extensive repeatables for ground armies. Orbital bombardment is essentially mandatory to conquer the worlds without an army strength of 2k+. An empire with access to a Colossus can use the Neutron Sweep to clear out the inhabitants and then recolonize the planet, although since this will cost you the unique buildings it is usually not a good idea.
 - A better alternative, if available, is to use a Devolving Beam. This will convert all pops expect for one into pre-sapients, causing them to be ejected from their jobs and thus delete all defense armies present. This will cause all buildings expect for the capital building to become ruined, but they can be repaired and are thus not lost.

- Fallen Empire fleets are considerably more powerful than the diplomacy menu or fleet power counter might suggest. Their fleets can easily destroy battlegroups twice as powerful if not well optimized. Before declaring early wars on Fallen Empires, consider the possibility of losing most, or even all, of your assault fleets. Because of that, other players in multiplayer or powerful AIs in singleplayer will most likely opportunistically declare war on you during your war with a Fallen Empire, so either leave some of your fleets behind or build up significant starbase defenses.
- Fallen Empire troop transports should ideally be defeated in space as they can capture even heavily fortified planets rather easily due to their extensive stat bonusese from repeatables. Any garrisons they leave will also benefit from these bonuses, making it quite costly to recapture planets lost to their ground armies. Since they cannot make claims though, it may also be worth ignoring lost planets to press for an offensive campaign.
- Unless you have a massive fleet power advantage, it is not advisable to fight in a star system in which a Fallen Empire has a Citadel unless you have already defeated and weakened their fleets. Fallen empires fight very aggressively, providing plenty of opportunities to fight them in your territory and in star systems of your preference.
- One of the Fallen Empires' greatest advantages over even superior empires is the speed and maneuverability of their fleets on the strategic scale. Battlecruisers and Escorts can outpace equivalent vessels well into the late game with their Dark Matter Propulsion technology, and their fleets always completely ignore the borders of any other empires allowing them to avoid combat entirely before sweeping through undefended systems, further exacerbated by their ability to take wormholes or active gateways anywhere in the galaxy. Jump Drives are frequently necessary to pin down a fleet before it can escape a player's range, further helping negate the numerical advantages of any opponents due to the 200-day jump drive recharge debuff.
 - Some methods of counteracting this include building FTL Megastructures to enhance your infrastructure and give your ships more comparable mobility. Gateways will help with connecting strategically important points in your empire together, Hyper Relays will accelerate fleet movement throughout your realm and Quantum Catapults (particularly if used in conjunction with a Sentry Array) can be used to launch precision strikes against strategically important targets and vulnerable weak points, bypassing enemy fleets altogether. This is especially effective if you have the Slingshot to the Stars origin, due to the bonuses it gives to Quantum Catapults. Lastly (as a last resort), Fallen Empire ships are affected by FTL inhibition, so fortifying your systems with upgraded Starbases and Defense Platforms, Deep Stace Citadels, Ringworlds and Fortress worlds will hinder their advance as much as possible.

### Dormant empire

A dormant fallen empire cannot build ships, which makes them vulnerable to a war of attrition or a decisive defeat. If you have Defensive Pacts, you may provoke the Fallen Empire into declaring war so you have allies to improve your chances of winning. A Federation is even better, as friendly AI empires will typically agree to an offensive war if there is even a moderate chance at victory.

The main goal in the first war (if not outright conquest) should be to acquire their technology via salvage, as this can drastically improve the chances in any future wars. If you are not confident in a total conquest, focus on their core planets as these supply the majority of their economy and have valuable buildings. Fallen Empire border colonies are by comparison very underdeveloped and not particularly useful if captured in isolation.

Be warned that taking any Fallen Empire planets increases the chance of one FE awakening massively (to a near certainty), if that did not already happen. This applies to all Fallen Empires, which means that even if you manage to completely annex a Fallen Empire, you might end up waking up another. Be aware that with standard game settings, the fleet power requirement for awakening is very easy to satisfy at end-game by any empire, so it is wise to assume an awakening will happen eventually and include in your long-term strategy.

Critically, Fallen Empires (excluding destruction of Holy Worlds) cannot awaken when engaged in war. If you are certain that you are strong enough to erase them from the galaxy map, do it while they are still sleeping to prevent them from awakening. Otherwise, you may also declare extended wars to destroy their fleets without pressing claims, dragging out the period where they cannot awaken. This is most effective with friendly AI empires to slow down your war exhaustion gain.

### Awakened empire

There are several ways of fighting an Awakened Empire, depending on your position when they awaken

All empires may use the Containment casus belli (which will lead to a total war) against an Awakened Empire regardless of ethics. This can greatly shift empire borders if a quick victory is not attained.

The strongest empires can face an awakened Fallen Empire head-on and defeat them in one go, especially if they have allies. Otherwise, the long-term goal should be to acquire as much territory as possible, in particular that of other still dormant fallen empires. Be advised that any system Awakened Empires capture will mean an additional starbase they might build to reinforce their fleets more quickly.

If conventional war does not seem feasible, temporarily submitting to the Awakened Empire is an alternate strategy. Once they awaken, Fallen Empires will acquire decadence. Decadence reduces their income and fleet power while also increasing the rebelliousness of their subjects. Be patient, build up your forces and wait for the right moment to rebel and overthrow them.

If an endgame Crisis occurs, the Benevolent Interventionists or the Watchful Regulators may become Guardians of the Galaxy. They will stop trying to reduce empires to signatories or satellites and form a federation instead, so it's unnecessary to fight them if they awaken late enough. Alternatively, opportunistic players may use this to beeline their core territories while their fleets are away fighting the Crisis.

### War in Heaven

A War in Heaven will dramatically change the power balance of the entire galaxy in a short time, since it can quickly become a three-way battle royale that lasts until two of the warring factions are eliminated.

Regardless of which side you choose, remember that War in Heaven is a Total War casus belli, which means that any occupied systems will immediately change ownership. Choose your side wisely and keep in mind that the most important thing is always to survive while trying to either outlast or destroy your opponents. A careless choice may mean the end of your empire.

- If you're too close to one of the awakened empires, joining their side may become the best choice unless you're strong enough to stop their fleets or stall ground offensives. If you are a Scion, you will automatically join your overlord in the war, without any choice in the matter
- In nearly all other cases, joining the League of Non-Aligned Powers will be the best choice. Normal AI empires will overwhelmingly favor joining the League, so it is all but guaranteed that most or even all empires will unite against the Awakened Empires. This will provide an enormous front that is nearly impossible for either Awakened Empire to fully conquer.
- If you are more powerful than the Awakened Empires you are safe to remain neutral. Awakened Empires will not declare war on empires with greater Relative Power and staying neutral will make you eligible to lead or join the League of Non-Aligned Powers.
- If the Galactic Imperium has been formed, both Fallen Empires will automatically declare war on the emperor in addition to each other, and all members of the Imperium will automatically join the Emperor as a war ally. Note that you cannot claim systems that have already been claimed by a war ally once the war has started. You will not be given the option to side with a fallen empire or stay neutral in this case.

If you want to avoid a War in Heaven, prioritize destroying one of the empires with opposing ethics, as Fallen Empires of non-opposing ethics are less likely to start it.
