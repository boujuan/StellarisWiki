# Ascension perks

**Ascension perks** grant powerful, empire-wide benefits that can shape the course of a civilization's development, opening paths to greater strength, resilience, or transcendence. They are unlocked by finishing an entire tradition tree or acquiring the Ascension Theory technology. An empire can have up to 8 ascension perks.

## List of ascension perks

Some perks require a number of other ascension perks to be taken first. Tier 0 ascension perks can be taken from the start. Tier 1 perks require 1 previous ascension perk to be taken, tier 2 perks require 2 previous ascension perks, and tier 3 perks require 3 previous ascension perks. The higher the AI weight, the more likely an AI empire will select that ascension perk.

If the Shadows of the Shroud DLC is enabled, most ascension perks also grant +30 Attunement with certain Shroud patrons.

### Ascension paths

Ascension paths are special ascension perks that unlock a tradition tree , as well as an agenda with the same name that unlocks technologies required to advance through the tradition tree. Each empire can only take one of these perks, and only if they have already selected two ascension perks and have an empty tradition slot available.

- Empires with a Civics, Natural Design civic cannot pursue ascension and therefore cannot pick any of these perks.
- Certain origins lock the empire into a specific ascension path. Empires with those origins cannot pick any of these perks, but can adopt the relevant ascension tradition tree without the ascension perk.
 - Empires with the Teachers of the Shroud or Endbringers origin can adopt the Psionics tradition tree without Mind Over Matter.
 - Empires with the Cybernetic Creed origin can adopt the Cybernetics tradition tree without The Flesh is Weak.
 - Empires with the Synthetic Fertility origin can adopt the Synthetics tradition tree without Synthetic Evolution.

- Cybernetic ascension:
 - Empires with the Hard Reset origin can initially only pick The Flesh is Weak. If the founder species gains the De-Cyberized trait it can no longer pick The Flesh is Weak but unlocks the other ascension paths. A Cyberized Hard Reset empire can adopt the Cybernetics tradition tree without The Flesh is Weak.

- Biological ascension:
 - Empires with the Clone Army origin cannot pick the Biomorphosis ascension perk until they complete the Genetic Crossroads event chain. If they complete the event chain, they can pick the Biomorphosis ascension perk as their first ascension perk. Clone Army empires with Clone Potential path can only select Cloning options during the ascension situation.
 - Empires with the Overtuned origin can pick Biomorphosis as their second ascension perk.

- Psionic ascension:
 - Empires with the Shroud-Forged origin cannot pick Interdimensional Processing, but can adopt the Psionics tradition tree without it if they completed the situation by supporting the Shroud-Forged.
 - Empires with the machine species require 3 previous ascension perks instead of 2 to take Interdimensional Processing unless they have taken the Chosen civic.

| | Ascension perk | Tradition tree | Situation | Blocks other options | Requirements | AI weight | DLC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | **Mind Over Matter** Only a fraction of the potential contained within our minds has been unlocked. The latent psionic abilities of our species are only now beginning to manifest in certain individuals. | Psionics | | - Chosen<br>- Entropy Drinkers | - Organic founder species<br>- No Hive Mind (unless )<br>- No Mindwardens | **100**<br>- ×2 if Galactic Nemesis<br>- ×2 if Daemonic Incursion<br>- ×2 if a Mindwardens empire exists<br>- ×0.5 if not Spiritualist | |
| | **Synthetic Evolution** It is time to abandon the flawed organic vessels that imprison our minds. By transferring our neural patterns into synthetic bodies, we will achieve a higher state of being. | Synthetics | | | - Organic founder species<br>- No Hive Mind<br>- No Galvanic Synthesis | **100**<br>- ×2 if Mechanist<br>- ×0.5 if not Materialist<br>- ×0.3 if a Mindwardens empire exists<br>- ×0 if Artificial Intelligence policy is set to Outlawed<br>- ×0 if Robotic Workers policy is set to Outlawed<br>×0 for certain civics and origins<br>Necrophage origin Clone Army origin Overtuned origin Idyllic Bloom civic Minamar Specialized Industries | |
| | **The Flesh is Weak** **Organo-Machine Interfacing** The limits and constraints imposed on us by our feeble organic bodies are simply unacceptable. To reach our full potential, we must turn to cybernetic implants. | Cybernetics | | Augmentation Bazaars | - Either:<br>  - Organic founder species<br>  - Driven Assimilator | **100**<br>- ×2 if Driven Assimilator<br>- ×0.5 if Individualist and not Materialist<br>- ×0.3 if a Mindwardens empire exists | |
| | **Biomorphosis** To leave our genetic destiny in the hands of nature is an inefficient and excruciatingly slow process. Why not jump-start the future of our species? | - Without BioGenesis:<br>  - Genetics<br>- With BioGenesis:<br>  - Cloning<br>  - Mutation<br>  - Purity | Biomorphosis | - Wilderness<br>- Evolutionary Predators | Organic founder species | **100**<br>- ×2 if Clone Army<br>- ×2 if Life-Seeded<br>- ×2 if Necrophage<br>- ×2 if Syncretic Evolution<br>- ×2 if Evolutionary Predators<br>- ×0.3 if a Mindwardens empire exists | |
| | **Synthetic Age** The age of organics has come and gone, the future of the galaxy belongs to the machines. This is the dawn of a synthetic age. | - Without The Machine Age:<br>  - Synthetics<br>- With The Machine Age:<br>  - Modularity<br>  - Nanotech<br>  - Virtuality | Transformation | | Machine founder species | **100**<br>- ×0.5 if Driven Assimilator<br>- ×0.3 if a Mindwardens empire exists | |
| | **Interdimensional Processing** Our calculation potential is limited when constrained only to the three physical dimensions. There is more to be gained by reaching our network into the spaces beyond the void. | Psionics | | - Chosen<br>- Entropy Drinkers | Machine founder species | **100**<br>- ×2 if Galactic Nemesis<br>- ×2 if a Mindwardens empire exists<br>- ×0.5 if not Spiritualist | |

### Crisis perks

Crisis perks are special ascension perks that unlock a crisis empire progression. Each empire can only take one of these perks, and only if they have already selected 3 ascension perks. They cannot be taken if the empire is a Subject, Galactic Custodian, Galactic Emperor, or has the Defender of the Galaxy ascension perk or Endbringers origin. They also cannot be taken by the Minamar Specialized Industries. The Shroud-Forged origin may either be locked out of the Galactic Nemesis perk or be able to unlock it without any prior ascension perks, depending on how the Forged by the Shroud situation is resolved. Crisis perks are not inherited by sectors released as vassals but the technologies unlocked by them are.
