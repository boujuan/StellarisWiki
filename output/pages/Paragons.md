# Paragons

**Paragons** are unique leaders with special backstories, portraits and predefined traits that can be obtained as part of certain events. Most paragons have their destiny trait unlocked early and instead gain another veteran trait at level 8. All paragons have a veteran class, even if the Galactic Paragons DLC is not enabled.

AI empires can not recruit any renowned or legendary paragons.

## Renowned paragons

### Astrocreator Azaryn

| Class | Paragon trait | Other traits | Ethic | Age | Skill level |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| - Scientist<br>- Scholar | - Terraformation Nuclei | - Perceptive Mentor<br>- Xeno-Cataloger<br>- Spark of Genius | Xenophile | Immortal | |

Astrocreator Azaryn has a 1% chance to appear every 5 years in empires that are not Militarist or Gestalt Consciousness. Once that happens, a random empire is contacted twice. The second time, it will offer a special project that requires 180 days. Completing the project issues a second special project that requires 1000 society research. Completing the second project grants 2000 society research and issues a third special project that requires 4000 society research. Completing the third project grants 5000 society research. After each special project, the empire is asked two questions. 60 days after all projects have been completed, Astrocreator Azaryn is recruited. The empire capital gains a bonus to happiness, pop growth speed, resources from jobs, worker output, and researcher output for 2 years. How large the bonus is depends on the answers to the questions. The following answers increase the effect of the modifier:

- Is this a trick question?
- Yes, we would.
- We would.
- Yes. Decisive actions require consideration.

Azaryn commands a science ship that has the ability to terraform three planets into Gaia Worlds with the Overgrowth modifier at the cost of 10000 Energy and 10 years. Barren Worlds can be terraformed too, but the time is increased to 25 years. Ecumenopolis planets cannot be terraformed. The science ship merely starts the process and does not have to wait. Azaryn's appearance changes each time a terraforming process is started, and once the third terraforming process is started, she dies, which unlocks the Contained Ecosphere empire building and awards the Dawn Of A Million Souls achievement.

Each time a terraforming process is started, there is a 25% chance to be offered a special project. Completing the special project grants 5000 society research and the next terraforming technology. If all terraforming technologies have been researched, it instead grants an additional 15000 society research. There is a 25% chance that a few months after the special project has been completed, the empire must pay either 2500 energy or 1000 society research and 500 minerals and alloys.

### Keides, Scion of Vagros

| Class | Paragon trait | Other traits | Skill level |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scientist | Nebulous Past | - Erudite<br>- Scrapper | |

Keides, Scion of Vagros can be recruited after 20 years by the first empire that investigates the Dugar unique system. An event 10 years before he becomes available lets the empire choose which ethic Keides has. Gestalt Consciousness empires can find the system but cannot recruit him.

A few months after Keides is recruited, he adds 3 Points of Interest to the Situation Log. Entering those systems adds a special project in each that needs 2 years and can only be researched by him. Completing each special project upgrades the The Key relic. Once all 3 special projects are completed, the empire receives one final special project that requires 4000 physics research. Completing it grants 6000 physics research and creates a wormhole in the capital system leading to the Sursect system, where Keides can fully upgrade The Key to its final form after and excavate the Vagrosian Ruins archaeological site to gain the Ancestral Inheritance trait, as well as an option to change leader class. The A Tad Too Late achievement will be awarded as well.

This chance jumps to 50% if the empire has previously built or reactivated a gateway or progressed the Ancient Capital City archaeological site beyond the 2nd stage. For empires with the Galactic Doorstep origin, the chances are instead 33% and 67%. In 4-8 months, the empire gains a special project that requires an army. Once the project is completed, the empire gains the option to invade the ship. There is a 20% chance to take control of the ship and an 80% chance the ship becomes hostile. Empires that are not Gestalt Consciousness or Fanatic Xenophobe have the option to gain a special project that requires a construction ship instead. Completing it recruits Skrand Sharpbeak.

The ship has the following components:

| Section | Components |
|---|---|
| Core | Jump Drive, Dark Matter Reactor, Dark Matter Thrusters, Tachyon Sensors, Advanced Combat Computer (Carrier) |

- Lessons of the Past
- New Species
- Study The Crisis
- Study The Talon
- Upgrade The Talon

Within a few decades after the Command Integration and Talon Study situations have been completed, the empire unlocks the Skravird Strike Craft technology.

If the Ancient Capital City archaeological site is excavated while Skrand Sharpbeak is recruited, he gains 800 experience.
