# Starbase

Starbases are upgradeable military installations that establish and secure ownership of star systems.

## Mechanics

### Construction

Constructing a starbase requires first fully surveying the desired system.

The build cost is 100 alloys if Mechanical shipset or 50 alloys and 175 food if using Biological shipset, and an additional influence cost on top of that.

The influence cost is a base of 75, multiplied by the number of hyperlane jumps, including bypasses , between the target systems and the empire's closest owned system. This is reduced by the Slingshot to the Stars origin, which reduces the distance multiplier by 75%. For example, an adjacent system (1 jump) costs 75 influence, a system 2 jumps away costs 150 influence, or 94 influence with Slingshot to the Stars. Other modifiers to the total influence cost can be found below.

| Starbase influence cost 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Devouring Swarm civic | −50% |
| Fanatic Xenophobe ethic | −40% |
| Determined Exterminator civic | −30% |
| Xenophobe ethic | −20% |
| Interstellar Dominion ascension perk | −20% |
| Reach for the Stars tradition | −10% |

Once built, the starbase will appear orbiting the center point of the system. A starbase cannot be destroyed by any regular means; when a starbase is reduced to 0 hull points it is disabled, but not destroyed.

A starbase can be destroyed by:

- being dismantled by its owner during peacetime if it is of no more than outpost level (higher-level starbases will need to be downgraded first) and the system is not colonized.
- being reduced to 0 hull points, and it is belonging to or attacked by a Crisis faction.
- a star in the system of the starbase being cracked by a Star-Eater .
- its owner has been defeated in a war and the system isn't fully occupied or has claims upon it.

If a starbase is dismantled or destroyed, the system reverts to being neutral and unowned and can then be claimed by any empire. Stations in the system will become unowned and slowly lose health.

If a system has a colony, but no starbase, and there is no hostile fleet present nor the planet is occupied, a new outpost will be built at the start of the next month.

### Upgrades

Besides the initial influence cost, upgrading the starbase to a higher level costs either alloys or a mixture of alloys and food. Apart from increasing the starbase's base potency and durability upgrades enable the construction of modules and buildings, each of which offer additional capabilities, and enable it to better contribute to your empire beyond its normal role of system control.

One such important module is the Shipyard, which enables the construction of ships at the starbase, and having multiple allows it to effectively act as a "fleet manufactory" by constructing several ships simultaneously in parallel. Shipyard build order is independent from the main build order of starbase. Another important module is the Gun Battery, which adds two Medium weapon slots directly to the starbase, and one extra defense platform capacity. An entire starbase outfitted with multiple becomes a wall of guns, useful for delaying early game fleet aggression and acting as a stopgap until your more powerful and mobile fleets can arrive.

Though it is not possible to design a starbase, its components will be auto-fitted with the latest advanced technology as soon as they are made available (at no additional cost to the owner).

### Starbase capacity

The number of upgraded starbases that an empire can support without penalty is determined by the starbase capacity. Every upgraded starbase exceeding that capacity adds Upkeep 25% upkeep for all starbases. Any penalty to upkeep also affects the upkeep of modules and buildings on starbases. Regardless of their level, each starbase above "outpost" level occupies only one capacity slot.

The base starbase capacity is 3. This is increased by 1 for every 10 owned systems, and can also be increased by the following:

| Starbase capacity 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Strategic Coordination Center (Stage III) | +6 |
| Grasp the Void ascension perk | +5 |
| Trading Posts civic | +4 |
| Strategic Coordination Center (Stage II) | +4 |
| Fortify the Border edict | +2 |
| Unyielding tradition tree adoption effect | +2 |
| Fortress Doctrine tradition | +2 |
| Stellar Expansion technology | +2 |
| Manifest Destiny technology | +2 |
| Strategic Coordination Center (Stage I) | +2 |
| Interstellar Expansion technology (repeatable 5 times) | +1 |

If the need arises, an empire can always downgrade existing starbases back to outpost level to reduce the number of upgraded starbases to within the cap.

## Warfare behavior

Systems with starbases above outpost level require 25 more influence to claim. Additionally, those starbases grant a higher war-score if occupied successfully ( **10** occupation value). During war, an attacker must disable the enemy's starbase within the system in order to be able to seize control of any planets within said system. As starbases cannot be destroyed, this is achieved by reducing the Health Hull points down to 0, disabling the starbase. The starbase will then remain incapacitated for a duration of Time 30 days (after the latest attack), during which time any military ships in close proximity to the starbase will be able to gain control over it. If control of the starbase is uncontested, it will enter a self-repair phase and then become operational again as soon as it regains Health 5% Hull points. When a starbase is disabled, control of the starbase will be assigned to its owner, the war participant with the strongest system claim, or the war participant with the nearest fleet, in that order.

Occupied starbases are fully operational and can repair ships of the side that controls it, inhibit FTL for "enemy" ships, and all empire-wide bonuses will also be applied, including home territory modifiers. However, the buildings and modules cannot be changed, and the starbase cannot be upgraded or downgraded, although it can be returned to the owner. If a starbase is occupied all stations in the system will be taken over by the occupier. The Army Builder tab will also display all armies currently being recruited by its original owner.

It is worth noting that auto-upgrading a starbase can "gift" higher tech components to occupied starbases (including FTL inhibitors), while keeping their own more advanced components. They will stay equipped even if said starbase is reclaimed back, so repeated re-conquering might become harder for both sides.

Starbases have the following inherent bonuses, making their weapons stronger than those of ships and platforms:

- +50% Fire Rate
- +20% Weapons Range

After the FTL Inhibition technology has been researched upgraded starbases will include an FTL inhibitor which prevents enemy ships from leaving the system via any hyperlane other than the one they arrived through until the starbase is disabled or occupied.

## Level

A starbase is auto-fitted with the latest components as soon as they are available to the empire. This is done automatically and has no additional cost for the empire - as such this also does not affect a starbase's level upgrade cost.

The weapon slots are fitted with the most effective kinetic and energy weapons (though not necessarily by equal division). The utility slots are divided equally between Shield shield and Armor armor components (auto-fitting does not add hull components here), while the auxiliary slot uses standard auto-fitting of a shield capacitor or auxiliary fire-control (whatever is available in order of priority).

Upgrading a starbase requires the technology of the same name and can only be done in sequential order - meaning that upgrading a basic outpost to a citadel requires going through every level in between to get to the desired level. Downgrading a starbase reduces it to outpost level immediately and removes all buildings and modules. Defense platforms will remain even if above the outpost's capacity. Any resources invested into the starbase prior to downgrading will not be refunded.

Starting from starport level, all starbases have an FTL inhibitor if the FTL Inhibition technology has been researched.

**Note:** The table lists the base properties of each starbase level. The actual values themselves will differ due to one's progress in-game (technology, tradition, and etc.), existing modifiers (if any) as well as individual starbase composition (buildings, modules, and etc.).

| | Level | Mechanical cost | Biological cost | Time | Upkeep | Modules | Buildings | Platforms | Hull | Armor | Weapons | Utilities | Repairs docked fleets |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tech starbase 1 | **Outpost** | 100 | 50 175 | Time 100 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 | Health 5000 | Armor 1000 | 1 | 2 1 | No |

## Modules

A fully upgraded starbase can support up to 6 modules. It is possible to construct multiple modules of the same type and the starbase will be described in the outliner depending on the majority module type. Each module takes Time 180 days to construct and has an energy upkeep of 1 unit per month.

| Module | Cost | Effects | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Anchorage** Fleet anchorages are necessary to support the growth of our navy. | 50 | - +4 Naval capacity<br>  - +2 with Naval Logistics Office building | |

### Fleet modules

Fleet modules allow the starbase to construct fleets. Multiple fleet modules may be constructed to produce multiple ships or space fauna in parallel but only one type of fleet module can be constructed on a starbase.

| Module | Cost | Can produce | | | Vivarium capacity | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Civilian ships | Military ships | Space fauna | | | | |
| **Shipyard** A Shipyard may build one ship at a time, in parallel with other Shipyards. | 50 | Yes | Yes | No | | |

Their shipyards produced a constant stream of ships for their navy and merchant fleets, which would ultimately be their downfall. With so many ships, and such a high reliance on them, the Irassians were powerless to quarantine the disease that would claim their empire. | Time 360 | 100 45 | 2 | - +1 Shipyard capacity from all shipyards<br>- +20% Ship build speed | +10% Ship build speed | - **Irassian Naval Yards** technology<br>- Shipyard on starbase |

They were so focused on disproving any claim of alien life, that their bias found a way into their technology. However, with the proper modifications and calibrations, we could certainly fix their powerful detection arrays. | Time 360 | 100 45 | 2 | - +7 Sensor range<br>- +14 Hyperlane detection range | - +3 Sensor range<br>- +6 Hyperlane detection range | **Yuht Astronomical Interferometer** technology |

## Defenses

Because starbases are vital targets during warfare, an empire must ensure that they can maintain control over their own starbases to prevent their opponents from seizing control of the system. Investing resources into arming a starbase can allow it to function as a strong deterrent to enemy invasions, a powerful supporting power during a fleet battle in the system, and a starbase that is heavily armed enough can potentially even repel an entire enemy fleet by itself. Successfully maintaining control over every single starbase in the empire is by itself enough to allow an empire to end the war through a status-quo without losing any systems, earning them a defensive victory.

The basic starbase defenses are turrets. Starbase turrets are always of medium size. The number of slots increases with each starbase level and more can be added by building Gun Batteries. The type of weapon cannot be chosen; slots will be filled by the highest possible tier of an automatically chosen type of weapon. The only way to diversify the armaments is to add guided weapons by building Missile Batteries or strikecraft by building Hangar Bays. It is advised to reinforce critical starbases with defense platforms and to not rely only on turrets.

Defense platforms are smaller military stations that are deployed around the starbase and act as additional weapons platforms, adding their firepower to the starbases while diverting enemy fire. Unlike starbases, their loadout can be customized in the ship designer, allowing for several designs to be built based on the different needs on each front and to be upgraded based on these designs. However, unlike ships, platforms cannot be retrofitted to a different design once built, necessitating dismantling and completely rebuilding in order to change designs. It also renders any transferred platforms non-upgradable.

When compared with ships, platforms are situated between destroyer and cruiser classes , their hull and armament slightly better than the former, while their armor potential is equivalent to the latter. However, due to them having no evasion whatsoever, individual platforms are still very vulnerable, and if strong, sustainable firepower is a priority, it is wiser to put more turrets on the base itself and only add in defense platforms once the starbases available armaments have been maxed out.

Each starbase has a base capacity of 3 defense platforms. It can be increased by the following:

| Defense platform cap (empire) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Strategic Coordination Center (Stage III) | +12 |
| Strategic Coordination Center (Stage II) | +8 |
| Eternal Vigilance ascension perk | +5 |
| Strategic Coordination Center (Stage I) | +4 |
| Overlord modifiers | |
| Vigil Command holding ( Bulwark tier III) | +4 |
| Vigil Command holding ( Bulwark tier II) | +2 |
| Vigil Command holding ( Bulwark tier I) | +1 |
| Subject modifiers | |
| Bulwark tier III | +8 |
| Bulwark tier II | +5 |
| Bulwark tier I | +2 |

| Defense platform cap (starbase) 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Citadel | +12 |
| Star Fortress | +9 |
| Defense Grid Supercomputer | +8 |

| Starport | +3 |
| Reloading Bay | +2 |
| Ancient Rampart | +2 |
| Gun Battery | +1 |
| Hangar Bay | +1 |
| Torpedo Battery | +1 |

With Apocalypse DLC, a fully upgraded Citadel can also support an Ion Cannon, a more powerful platform type with a single titan weapon . It takes up 8 defense platform capacity slots.
