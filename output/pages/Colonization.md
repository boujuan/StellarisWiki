# Colonization

**Colonization** is the process of establishing control over an uninhabited, habitable planet with a Colony Ship. Planets with an anomaly or a pre-FTL civilization cannot be colonized. Only species that have the Colonization Allowed species rights can colonize and if the species rights are changed or the planet changes hands at the end of a war to an empire that does not give the colonizing species the same rights, the colonization process is canceled.

## Habitability

**Habitability** is the measure of how comfortably a species can live on a planet. Most species have a climate preference for one of the primary habitable planet types, although more exotic preferences are possible. A planet's habitability for a given species is determined by how closely its climate matches that species' preference. The 9 regular habitable world types are divided into 3 climate categories: dry, frozen, and wet. Mechanical and Machine species have habitability traits for climate groups rather than individual planet types. Ring Worlds, Gaia Worlds, and Ecumenopolises have maximum habitability for all species, while Tomb Worlds, Machine Worlds, and Hive Worlds normally have 0% habitability and require certain traits for pops to comfortably live there.

| Tier | Base |
|---|---|
| Gaia World, Ecumenopolis, and Ring World | 100% |
| Hive World for Hive-Minded species | 100% |
| Machine World for Machine species | 100% |
| Relic World or exact match | 80% |
| Robotic climate match | 75% |
| Climate category match | 60% |
| Robot climate category mismatch | 50% |
| Habitat (Tier III) | 60% |
| Habitat (Tier II) | 50% |
| Habitat (Tier I) | 40% |
| Climate category mismatch | 20% |
| Tomb World, Machine World, and Hive World | 0% |

- Every **1%** reduction of habitability below 100% increases pops' Upkeep upkeep and amenities usage by +1% and reduces their job efficiency and species growth by −0.5% . It floors at 0% Habitability, giving +100% pop upkeep and amenities usage, and −50% job output and pop growth.
- Homeworlds have +30% habitability for the species originating from them.
- Low habitability can trigger various events.
- A confirmation message pops up if you attempt to settle a planet with less than 70% habitability.
- In some cases, there may be a raised habitability floor or a lowered habitability ceiling:
 - Robotic pops or species with Cave Dweller or Molebots traits have a habitability floor of 50%. This can stack, giving Molebots effectively 100% habitability everywhere.
 - The habitability ceiling can be reduced to below 100%, such as pops with Noxious traits or from certain rare blockers .
 - The habitability floor overrides the habitability ceiling if it is higher.

There are four ways to improve habitability:

- Terraforming the planet. This needs a certain technology and may have additional requirements depending on the original planet. Some terraforming methods also require an ascension perk .
- Modifying the climate preference of the pops, which requires the Glandular Acclimation technology for biological pops (robots/machines do not require technology to change habitability), or adding traits that increase habitability. A template with the appropriate traits can be applied to pops on relevant planets, or used by colony ships.
- Obtaining alien species with a different climate preference. This can be done by conquest, migration treaty, infiltrating a pre-FTL civilization, uplifting a pre-sapient species, certain events and offers, or purchasing from the Slave Market. Empires can colonize with any species that has migration access to the empire, even if no pops of that species currently live on the empire's worlds, provided they have the Colonization Allowed species right.
- Researching technologies, acquiring traditions, or constructing buildings that increase base habitability.

### Habitability indicators

Systems containing habitable worlds have one or more planet icons that are either green, yellow, orange, red, or blue – depending on the habitability percentage and/or status of the planet(s) in question.

| Icon | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Colonizability green | World has at least 70% Habitability for at least one species in the player's empire that can colonize |
| Colonizability yellow | World has between 40% and 69% Habitability for at least one species in the player's empire that can colonize |
| Colonizability red | World has below 40% Habitabilityfor all species in the player's empire that can colonize |
| Colonizability orange | World is habitable but not surveyed |
| Colonizability blue | World is currently being terraformed |
| Colonizability white | World has a Terraforming Candidate modifier |

## Terraforming

Terraforming is the process of changing the planet classification of a planet in order to make it more habitable for a species. A planet must be surveyed and within the empire's borders to be terraformed. It is possible to terraform inhabited planets if the empire has the Ecological Adaptation technology. Doing so inflicts a −20% happiness penalty on the planet for the duration of the process.

The first time a planet is terraformed, there's a chance of triggering a terraforming event . Terraformed planets cannot receive colony events .

Some planet modifiers will be removed when terraforming a planet:

- Bleak
- Lush
- Irradiated
- Hazardous Weather
- Hostile Fauna
- Wild Storms
- Second Home
- Hyper Ecosystem
- Docile Fauna
- Obsidian Lakes

Terraforming cost and speed are affected by the following:

| Terraforming cost 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| World Shaper ascension perk | −25% |
| Genesis Guides civic | −25% |
| Unknown Secrets of the Baol empire modifier | −15% |
| Unknown Mask of Transformation empire modifier | −10% |
| Unknown Shallarian Terraforming Knowledge empire modifier | −10% |
| Environmental Control Board resolution (4) | +25% |
| The Paradise Initiative resolution (5) | +100% |

| Terraforming speed 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Terraforming Gases edict | +50% |
| Cartographer III councilor trait | +33% |
| Cartographer II councilor trait | +25% |
| Genesis Guides civic | +25% |
| Cartographer I councilor trait | +10% |
| Conquer Nature agenda | +10% |
| Unknown Shallarian Terraforming Knowledge empire modifier | +10% |
| Unknown Mask of Transformation empire modifier | +10% |
| Exotic Gases minor deficit | −20% |
| Exotic Gases major deficit | −40% |
| Exotic Gases severe deficit | −60% |
| Exotic Gases catastrophic deficit | −80% |

Some planets are unable to be terraformed by standard methods:

- Ecumenopoli and habitable megastructures cannot be terraformed
- Relic Worlds cannot be terraformed except by restoring it into an Ecumenopolis
- Planets with pre-sapients cannot be terraformed if their policy is set to Protected
- Several of the Scion of Vagros related planets cannot be terraformed
- Metal Planet cannot be terraformed

| New climate | Original climate | Regular cost | Wilderness cost | Years | Required technology |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| - Dry<br>- Wet<br>- Cold | Same climate type | 2000 | 1000 | Time 5 | Terrestrial Sculpting |
| Different climate type | 5000 | 2500 | Time 10 | | |
| Tomb Hive Machine | 10000 | 5000 | Time 20 | Climate Restoration | |
| Volcanic | 5000 | 2500 | Time 10 | Volcanic Terraforming | |

If an uncolonized planet is terraformed by Wilderness Empire, this planet will be automatically colonized. They can terraform uncolonized planets to the same planet type, which costs 500 biomass and takes Time 3 years, and require Ecological Adaptation technology to terraform uncolonized different climate planets.

### Special planet types

| New climate | Original climate | Regular cost | Wilderness cost | Years | Requirements | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gaia | Any regular climate | 7500 | 3500 | Time 10 | World Shaper ascension perk | A unique planet with the Previously Terraformed Planet modifier can be terraformed into Gaia World without the ascension perk. It costs 2000 energy and takes Time 5 years. |
| Tomb | 12500 | 6000 | Time 25 | | | |
| Hive | Any habitable | 10000 | No | Time 20 | Hive Worlds ascension perk | All planetary features except rare features are removed. |
| Machine | Any habitable | 10000 | No | Time 20 | Machine Worlds ascension perk | |
| Tomb | Any regular climate | 1000 100 100 | No | Time 10 | For Science! Industrialism policy | |
| Gaia | 2500 200 200 | No | Time 15 | | | |
| Volcanic | Any regular climate | 5000 | No | Time 5 | Galactic Hyperthermia crisis level 3 | |
| Tomb | 10000 | No | Time 20 | | | |
| Gaia | 2500 400 400 | No | Time 15 | | | |

If the planet is terraformed into a Machine World and there are any pops on the planet without the Cybernetic, Mechanical, or Machine traits, they are all killed, and the Organic Slurry feature is added.

WARNING: If a Holy World is terraformed into Tomb World or Volcanic World, the Holy Guardians will instantly awaken and declare a war on the perpetrator. The Holy World cannot be terraformed into Hive World or Machine World.

### Terraforming candidates

Planets that have a Terraforming Candidate modifier can be terraformed after researching the Climate Restoration technology.

| New climate | Original climate | Regular cost | Wilderness cost | Years | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dry | Barren (Dry) | 5000 | 2500 | Time 10 | |
| Cold | Barren (Cold) | | | | |
| Wet | Barren (Dry) Barren (Cold) | 10000 | 5000 | Time 15 | |
| Cold | Barren (Dry) | 15000 | 7500 | Time 20 | |
| Dry | Barren (Cold) | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| Gaia | Barren | 7500 | 3750 | Time 10 | World Shaper ascension perk |
| Hive | Barren | 10000 | No | Time 20 | Hive Worlds ascension perk |
| Machine | Barren | 10000 | No | Time 20 | Machine Worlds ascension perk |
| Tomb | Barren | 12500 | No | Time 25 | For Science! Industrialism policy |
| Volcanic | Barren | 10000 | No | Time 15 | Galactic Hyperthermia crisis level 3 |
| | | | | | |
| Any regular climate | Nanite | 1000 | 500 | Time 1 | |
| Any regular climate | Toxic | 10000 | 5000 | Time 10 | Detox ascension perk |
| Ocean | Frozen | 12500 | No | Time 25 | Hydrocentric ascension perk |

If the terraformed planet was a Toxic World, the following blockers are created:

- Poisonous Algae
- Rotten Soil
- Tainted Snowcaps
- Unpleasant Atmosphere
- Venomous Insects

### Alternative terraforming methods

Worlds can also be terraformed via terraforming decisions , which will terraform the world either instantly or when a situation started by the decision is completed.

In addition to the regular terraforming mechanics above, certain buildings, events, special projects, or other actions can terraform a planet.

**The following can turn a planet into aGaia World:**

1. Idyllic Bloom empires can build Gaia Seeders buildings and Gaia Seeder Outpost holdings, which turn planets into Gaia Worlds.
2. The science ship used by Astrocreator Azaryn has the ability to terraform 3 planets into Gaia Worlds with the Overgrowth modifier at the cost of 10000 Energy and 10 years. Barren Worlds, even without the Terraforming Candidate modifier, can be terraformed this way as well but the time is increased to 25 years. The science ship merely starts the process and does not have to stay there.

**The following can turn a planet into aTomb World:**

1. Armageddon bombardment turns the planet into a Tomb World if the last pop is killed.
2. Javorian Pox bombardment turns the planet into a Tomb World if the last pop is killed. If there are Mechanical or Machine pops on the planet, they will not be killed, preventing the terraforming.
3. The Worm can terraform all planets and moons in the empire's capital system, habitable and uninhabitable alike, into Tomb Worlds; only Gas Giants, Relic Worlds, and Ecumenopoli are spared. Moreover, the climate preference of every pop living on those planets is changed to Tomb World Preference.
4. Relentless Industrialists can build Coordinated Fulfillment Center and Universal Productivity Alignment Facility buildings, which turn planets into Tomb Worlds over time.
 - The first time triggers the Environmental Deterioration situation; if the situation reaches maximum, the planet turns into a Tomb World. After the situations ends, Industrialism policy is unlocked.
 - If the Industrialism policy is set to Full Steam Ahead or For Science! , further planets with a Coordinated Fulfillment Center are turned into Tomb Worlds in 30 years and planets with a Universal Productivity Alignment Facility turn into Tomb Worlds in 15 years, from now on without any warning. Only choosing the Cleanup policy stops this effect.

**The following can turn a planet into a different planet type:**

1. World Cracker colossus turns the planet into a Shattered World.
2. Deluge Machine colossus turns the planet into an Ocean World. It also kills all pops without an Aquatic trait. Owned planets can be targeted. If any pops remain, the colossus owner gains ownership of the planet if not already owned.
3. Toxic God colossus turns the planet into a Toxic World with the Toxic Terraforming Candidate modifier.
4. The Abandoned Terraforming Equipment and Glacial Crisis event chance may result in the planet being terraformed.

## Colony ships

Colony ships allow an empire to settle habitable planets or megastructures in owned systems. When ordering the construction of a colony ship, the player is given the option of choosing the species or sub-species of the pop(s) that is sent to the new colony. Pops are neither consumed nor transported in this process. Once constructed, the colony ship may be sent to any habitable world within an owned system to start a colony. Colony ships take one year to build and their upkeep cost is maintained throughout the whole colonization process. Colony ships can also be built through the interface of the world to be colonized, which automatically queues the colonization order as long as the path is not blocked. Selecting a colony ship will display the species inside.

Species require the Colonization Allowed species rights to be selected for new colony ships and if the species rights are changed afterwards those colony ships will not be able to colonize worlds.

The cost of a colony ship depends on the empire and its founder species class.

Empires with the Corporate Dominion or Private Prospectors civics can also construct **Private Colony Ships** , which cost 500 energy instead.

Empires with the Calamitous Birth origin can also construct **Lithoid Meteorites** , which cost 500 minerals instead, have no upkeep cost, and take only 150 days to build. Lithoid Meteorites also have a much faster sublight speed than regular colony ships. A planet colonized by a lithoid meteorite gains two Buried Lithoids blockers and the Lithoid Crater modifier.

Empires with Genesis Guides civic or equal variants cannot construct regular colony ships, they construct **Genesis Arks** instead. A planet colonized by a Genesis Ark gains a species with 300 Pre-Sapient pops and Genesis Preserve planetary feature.

Empires with Synthetic Fertility origin have same cost as Mechanical empires.

Empires with Wilderness origin cannot construct colony ships, they colonize worlds by terraforming instead.

Councilors with the Frontier Spirit trait reduce the cost of colony ships by −10% .

### Colony development

When a Colony Ship lands on a planet, a period of initial development occurs during which a colony is extremely vulnerable: just a few days of orbital bombardment wipes it out completely and the new colony does not produce any resources nor grows pops on the world. The initial development period lasts about 2 years and 10 months. Colony development speed can also be reduced by the following:

| Colony development speed 0 | |
|---|---|
| Source | Effect |
| Yuht Cryo Core relic | +200% |
| Evacuation Protocols edict | +100% |
| AI-controlled Colony Ships technology | +50% |
| Self-Aware Colony Ships technology | +50% |
| Leader with Frontier Spirit II on the council | +50% |
| Leader with Frontier Spirit I on the council | +33% |
| Machine Intelligence authority | +25% |
| Ceramo-Metal Infrastructure technology | +25% |
| Durasteel Infrastructure technology | +25% |
| Expansion tradition tree | +25% |
| Superior Colonies agenda | +25% |
| Expansionist diplomatic stance | +15% |

Once the colony has been successfully established, it starts with a tier 1 capital building and 100 Pops of the species selected for the colony ship.

### Open Seed Pods

Empires with the Fruitful Partnership origin have an alternative method of colonizing worlds: seed pods distributed by space fauna on uncolonized worlds can be activated by the "Open Seed Pods" special project. This enables a colony to be remotely established on a world with the seed pods for 3,000 energy without needing to build a colony ship. Once established, the new colony automatically creates an outpost if the system is unowned. This method cannot be used on uncolonized planets in systems owned by other empires.

## First colony

The first time a colony is established the empire will receive the following rewards:

- Authoritarian empires can choose to gain 250-100000 Engineering Research and +100% Authoritarian Ethics Attraction on the colony for 20 years
- Egalitarian empires can choose to gain 100-1000 Minerals and +100% Egalitarian Ethics Attraction on the colony for 20 years

- Militarist empires can choose to gain 250-100000 Society Research and +100% Militarist Ethics Attraction on the colony for 20 years
- Pacifist empires can choose to gain 100-1000 Consumer Goods and +100% Pacifist Ethics Attraction on the colony for 20 years
- Xenophile empires can choose to gain 100-1000 Energy and +100% Xenophile Ethics Attraction on the colony for 20 years
- Xenophobe empires can choose to gain 100-1000 Minerals and +100% Xenophobe Ethics Attraction on the colony for 20 years
- Hive Mind empires with a Organic founder species can choose to gain 100-1000 Food
- Hive Mind empires with a Lithoid founder species can choose to gain 100-1000 Minerals
- Machine Intelligence empires can choose to gain 100-1000 Energy
- Thermophile empires can choose to gain 100-1000 Alloys

- Storm Chasers empires can choose to gain 250-100000 Engineering Research
- Evolutionary Predators empires can choose to gain 250-100000 Engineering Research

For Wilderness Empires, initiate terraform on an uncolonized planet at the first time the empire will receive 250-100000 Engineering Research.
