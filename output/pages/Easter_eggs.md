# Easter eggs

: Why? Why?! WHY?! - Embracing the futility of life's questions in the Improbable Ceramics event
: My circuits hurt. - Same option for machine empires

Easter eggs are inside jokes and references to popular culture, included for the player's amusement. This is a non-exhaustive list of Easter eggs present in Stellaris. For others, also see the TVTropes page .

## The Blorg

During the pre-release stream series former Stellaris game director Wiz was inspired by one of the fungoid portraits to create a very friendly but hideously ugly species called the Blorg. The Blorg Commonality was a fanatic xenophile misunderstood empire that desperately wanted to make friends, and also had a militarist side in order to force others to be their friends if everyone rejected them. Due to fan requests, the empire was included in the game at launch, together with the Fanatic Befrienders AI personality, unique only to the Blorg and any empire with the exact same ethics and traits.

The Blorg became something of an inside joke within the game. The xenophile advisor references to the Blorg as friendly, the Subdermal Stimulation tech shows a Blorg body-pillow, the Chemical Bliss drugs it unlocks include Blorg bodily fluids, and the Uncanny trait (which describes machines made in the image of one of the most horrific species in the universe) shows a robotic Blorg. Finally, a possible name for black hole systems is Blorg's Bane.

Species with the Blorg portrait have a 1 in 140 chance to say "Umm...friends?" instead of regular fungoid sounds when contacted via the Contacts menu.

### Mercedes Romero

Mercedes Romero was a Blorg scientist from the pre-release dev livestreams who proved to be very popular on the forums. When she died of old age in one of the streams, the devs re-named Earth "Mercedia" in her honor and one of the soundtracks from the Utopia DLC was called "In Memory of Mercedes Romero". She was eventually added as a renowed paragon in the Astral Planes DLC.

## Collectivism and Individualism

Before the 1.5 patch Stellaris featured two additional ethics: Collectivist and Individualist. In patch 1.5 they were replaced by the Authoritarian and Egalitarian ethics respectively. Those ethics were very controversial and the source of many long-lasting forum arguments about their morality and thus were replaced with the more carefully-designed ethics present in the current version.

Those two ethics and the arguments they brought are referenced in an anomaly event describing how a primitive civilization destroyed itself after an ideological schism over the definitions and morality of collectivism and individualism. One of the dialogue options is Those aren't even real ethics... , referencing how they're no longer present in the game.

## Fallen Empires

The Fallen Empires are inspired by the Vorlons and the Shadows from Babylon 5 with their ancient technology, dogmatic focus on a single ethic and millennia of stagnation that eventually allow the younger races to catch up and surpass them.

The War in Heaven, named after a biblical event from the Book of Revelation, is also a reference to the Second Shadow War in the series Babylon 5. Humanity is caught in the middle of a war between two ancient forces: the awakened Shadows and their ancient rival - the Vorlon Empire. Humanity led the Army of Light opposing both ancients, by allying with the League of Non-Aligned Worlds and the Minbari Federation.

The achievement Last, Best Hope also refers to a line repeatedly said within the show that the eponymous station was the last, best hope for peace, and formed the aforementioned League of Non-Aligned Worlds. The achievement requires leading the said league to victory against both Awakened Empires.

When a Fallen Empire awakens the dialogue box also repeats a line from the series: Giants in the playground... .

Furthermore, the name references Warhammer 40,000 as well, where the "War in Heaven" is an ancient event involving a conflict between the fallen empires of the Old Ones and the C'Tan plus their scions Necrontyr, the latter from which the Necron ultimately emerged.

## The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Stellaris contains a number of references to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy novel series. More importantly though, the actual book is present in the game. One of the anomaly events from the Distant Stars DLC called Honeymooners leads to the discovery of the "alien travel guide", identically named The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which supposedly describes "many sights and phenomena still unknown to us". Xenophile and Xenophobe empires can use it to boost their respective ethics' attraction for 10 years.

One of the diplomacy messages when at war with a Fanatic Purifiers empire is This war will bring about an era of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life, and the obliteration of all other life forms.

One of the unique systems from Distant Stars contains a species called Prikki-Ti, which is sealed on their Shielded world inside a time warp and will become a Fanatic Purifier empire if they manage to get out alone or with player intervention. They are a reference to the Krikkit species from the third novel, which fails to exterminate all other life in the galaxy and gets sealed that way.

In Apocalypse if Earth is shattered with a World Cracker there is a 50% chance of creating a wormhole in the system leading to another newly created wormhole, something that also happens in the novels.
