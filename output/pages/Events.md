# Events

Not to be confused with Situations .

Events occur throughout the course of play. There are a whole range of **events** in the game, which can result in positive, negative and mixed outcomes for a player’s empire. They take the form of a pop-up notification on the player’s screen, which may present a player with a choice, or may simply inform the player of the consequences and require they acknowledge the event has occurred. Closing an event pop-up without making any choice will automatically choose the first option.

## Empire event chains


# Contact Report

Contact Report is one of the two most common event chains in the game, happening to every empire. Unlike other event chains, Contact Report does not have to start from the first event, and in that case previous events can no longer take place.

### Event: Fleet Maneuvers

Evt hangar bay

Commander [commander name] has drawn up plans for a major fleet exercise that will involve a substantial portion of our navy. The location [he or she] has chosen for these maneuvers is the [system name] system, which is close to the border of the [neighbor empire]. The [neighbor founder species plural] may see this as a major provocation, but if we cancel the exercise our military will consider it a sign of weakness. After all, [system name] lies within our space - the [neighbor empire] has no right to tell us what we can or cannot do in our own backyard.

- **Option:** **Unfortunate.**


# Horizon Signal

An eerie story written by the British writer Alexis Kennedy and introduced in the update 1.4, Horizon Signal is the longest and most complex chain in Stellaris. It is very rare and can bring massive changes to an empire's species. The event cannot happen to AI empires, so there is no risk of losing the opportunity by expanding too slowly.

When a new game is started, there is a 20% chance for the Horizon Signal event to activate in a random uncontrolled black hole system. It should be noted that the systems containing the Infinity Machine and the Dimensional Horror can never trigger the event.

If any event changes the traits of the founder species it will remove all incompatible traits, even if those are superior.

## Worm in Waiting: Signals

The Horizon Signal story begins with the The Worm-in-Waiting: Signals event chain, which can be triggered by a science ship with a scientist assigned to it entering the correct black hole system.

### Event: The Horizon Signal

Evt black hole

An alert communications officer has identified what appears to be a faint signal, almost lost in the gamma-ray flashes from the black hole here - faint, but unmistakably artificial. This raises intriguing possibilities for our scientists.

**Trigger conditions:** Not Gestalt Consciousness Science ship has a leader

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the correct black hole system

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Issue Special Project: Analyze the Horizon Signal

### Event: The Horizon Signal:GRAVITY IS DESIRE

Evt black hole

Science Officer [scientist name] reports that the signal was unexpectedly easy to decipher... but the team has spent considerable time confirming that it was not a hoax. It is a repeating, half-coherent message in the [empire adjective] language - something like a poem. It repeats the phrases GRAVITY IS DESIRE and TIME IS SIGHT . It encodes co-ordinates near the black hole. And it ends with a dedication by name to the Science Officer - who adds dispassionately that they have confirmed that the signal has been radiating into interstellar space before their birth. It fact, the signal may predate our civilization.

**Trigger conditions:** The Horizon Signal

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Analyze the Horizon Signal special project

- **Option:** **Fascinating! Send the vessel to those co-ordinates!**
 - Event: The Horizon Signal: THE WORM
- **Option:** **This is a trick, or a trap. Log it and move on.**
 - Event: The Horizon Signal: - message ends -

### Event: The Horizon Signal:THE WORM

Evt black hole

As the [science ship name] approaches the co-ordinates specified by the signal, it begins to report spatial distortions and curious lensing effects - a rich stream of valuable data. Then the transmission becomes distorted. What happens next is analyzed exhaustively. The excitement in Science Officer [scientist name]'s voice tautens to fear as the ship's hull struggles under increasingly exotic conditions. The ship triggers a distress call. [scientist name] cries out "the worm!" - or, perhaps, the Worm ! Then all transmissions end. No trace of the [science ship name] is ever found - no further transmissions, no debris, and the space at those co-ordinates is innocuous and utterly free of distortions. But the data they sent back has advanced our Physics research dramatically. Perhaps it was worth their lives.

### Event: The Horizon Signal: - message ends -

Evt black hole

[scientist name] complies, with a mixture of reluctance and relief. Their psych report later indicates that they are subject of recurring nightmares - of impossible labyrinths, of hungry vertigo of interstellar space, of their names being called in the dark. Within a homeworld year, the message has ceased.

### Event: The Horizon Signal:REPRISE

Evt black hole

The black hole in [system name] is active again. Once again, a looping signal flickers in the darkness at the edge of normal space. But this time, there's an acoustic message encoded in the signal. It sounds very much like [lost scientist name]'s voice. "What was shall be," intones, "what shall be was.". Then the same co-ordinates as the first signal, the co-ordinates where [lost scientist name] was lost - what the media christened "the Exit Point". Then they say a name: [scientist name] .

**Trigger conditions:** The Horizon Signal: THE WORM

**Mean time to happen:** Time 320 days

- **Option:** **[leader name] volunteers to go. Permit it.**
 - Event: The Horizon Signal: I'm Through
- **Option:** **Permit them to go, but rig their ship's drive to detonate.**
 - Event: The Horizon Signal: An Intervention
- **Option:** **Not this time. Ignore it.**
 - Event: The Horizon Signal: - message ends -

### Event: The Horizon Signal: I'm Through

Evt black hole

This time, the ship is running fully automated. [scientist name] is the only crew-member aboard. As it approaches the Exit Point, the telemetry stream fills up with fascinating data. Once again, space flexes, gravity uncoils. [scientist name] reads off the headline data, echoing the telemetry. They are commendably calm: we've sent a professional. It takes a little while for anyone to realize that something is peculiar about the timing. [scientist name] is no longer echoing the data: they're predicting it. The telemetry disagrees, but only for a few seconds, until it catches up. The monitoring team is just reporting that the prediction interval is increasing when [scientist name] says, wonderingly: "I'm through." "It's dark," they add. "That's not a problem. We can live in the dark. I never thought of that. But of course, we can live here forever - if the Worm will only wait - " At that moment, the signal cuts out, and the ship disappears from our team's sensors.

**Trigger conditions:** The Horizon Signal: REPRISE

**Is triggered only by:** Previous event choice

- **Option:** **This is horrible.**
 - Science ship and scientist are lost
- **Option:** **This is regrettable.**
 - Science ship and scientist are lost
- **Option:** **This is fascinating.**
 - Science ship and scientist are lost

### Event: The Horizon Signal: An Intervention

Evt debris

This time, [scientist name] is the only crew-member aboard. The ship is running fully automated... and its systems are programmed to detonate the drive once conditions match those immediately prior to the last ship's disappearance. As it approaches the exit point, the telemetry stream fills up with fascinating data. Once again, space flexes, gravity uncoils. [scientist name] reads off the headline data, echoing the telemetry. They are commendably calm: we've sent a professional. It takes a little while for anyone to realize that something is peculiar about the timing. [scientist name] is no longer echoing the data: They're predicting it. The telemetry disagrees, but only for a few seconds, until it catches up. Our monitoring team is just reporting that the prediction interval is increasing when there is a sudden energy spike. The drive has detonated: a brief flare of stellar fury, quickly lost in the darkness of [black hole name]. Whatever we encountered there, it may regret its interference. We'll never know. The Horizon Signal does not come again. But our team may find something interesting in the ashes of the ship.

**Trigger conditions:** The Horizon Signal: REPRISE

**Is triggered only by:** Previous event choice

- **Option:** **And yet, this may not be the end.**
 - Issue Special Project: Investigate fragments at Horizon Signal origin
 - Science ship and scientist are lost

### Event: The Horizon Signal:THE TRINE THE QUINE THE TRINE

Evt black hole

Once again, the Horizon Signal in [black hole name] is active. It has upped its game. Once again, the transmission includes the Exit Point's co-ordinates. It's signed with the private comm keys of [first lost scientist name] and [second lost scientist name]. But this time it's a generative text program written in an elderly programming language that creates what appear to be love poems - love poems directed to [scientist name]. They're honestly not very good love poems. But it is, our scientists agreee, quite difficult to generate love poems procedurally, and quite unusual for a black hole to send love poems at all.

**Trigger conditions:** The Horizon Signal: I'm Through

**Mean time to happen:** Time 320 days

- **Option:** **Well, it's asked nicely. Send [scientist name].**
 - Event: The Horizon Signal: Where the End Comes from
- **Option:** **Send [scientist name], with their drive rigged to blow.**
 - Event: The Horizon Signal: An Intervention
- **Option:** **This is sinister, and ridiculous, and sinister. Let it go.**
 - Event: The Horizon Signal: - message ends -

### Event: The Horizon Signal: A Lesson in the Ashes

Evt metropolis

We've reproduced conditions that approximate those around the black hole. We've found that the fragments we recover cycle between states, in ways that should be impossible - as if time were oscillating. We can derive energy from this - although there are worrying changes to local spacetime.

**Trigger conditions:** The Horizon Signal: An Intervention

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Investigate fragments at Horizon Signal origin special project

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Research option gained: Entropic Recursion

### Event: The Horizon Signal: Where the End Comes from

Evt black hole

This will be the end of me," [scientist name] says at the briefing before launch. "I know I won't come back. But I think I always knew this would happen. Whatever is in the hole has been waiting for us for a long long time - I think it's been waiting for me, since before I was born.". Once again, the single-pilot ship approaches the Exit Point. Once again, space boils like a fever. Again, our sensor arrays soak up fascinating data. This time, [scientist name] is silent. The telemetry becomes intermittent; and then it, too, is silent. The ship has reached the Exit Point. The conditions around it are returning to normal. Nothing has happened. Nothing? The monitoring team mutter furiously. The ship is different... in fact, it's a different ship. It's [first lost scientist name]'s vessel, lost these years past, drifting now away from the Exit Point. A salvage team finds it pristine and empty - no trace of crew, and no sign of violence. But there's a journal entry in [first lost scientist name]'s name, titled WHAT WAS WILL BE . Our scientists review it nervously. "Impossible," one says. "I hope so," says another. The ship is renamed the "Foundling" and returned to service. The Signal, dead or sleeping, says nothing at all, ever again.

**Trigger conditions:** The Horizon Signal: THE TRINE THE QUINE THE TRINE

**Is triggered only by:** Previous event choice

- **Option:** **And yet, this may not be the end.**
 - Research option gained: Entropic Recursion
 - Science ship and scientist are lost
 - Gain a science ship named "Foundling"

### Event: The Loop Temple: Signs in the Stone

Evt in the dark

Archaeologists have found a forgotten temple in the remote highlands of [capital name] - buried for centuries, but recently exposed by an earthquake. Dating techniques suggest it's a pre-industrial relic, hand-hewn from volcanic rock. However, the recurring symbol on the walls and radial altar - a Möbius-looped serpent consuming its own tail - has no obvious precedent in our early history, and the inscriptions use an unknown alphabet. One excitable archaeologist suggests it's a relic left by an unknown precursor race. In a presumably meaningless coincidence, the quake seems to have occurred at the same time as the final message from the black hole in [black hole system name].

**Trigger conditions:** Entropic Recursion unlocked

**Mean time to happen:** Time 320 days

- **Option:** **This merits study.**
 - Issue Special Project: Investigate the Loop Temple
- **Option:** **Ominous.**
 - Issue Special Project: Investigate the Loop Temple
- **Option:** **Spiritualist,A way has been opened for us.**
 - Issue Special Project: Investigate the Loop Temple

### Event: The Loop Temple: Time and Stone

Evt metropolis

Our scientists have learned a great deal about the subterranean temple, but some questions remain. A roof aperture, along with the radial altar, suggests it was once a solar calendar; but it's so badly damaged by the earthquake that we can't be certain. If the builders found particular dates important, we'll never know which ones. We've had better luck with the "unknown alphabet." It's a debased variant of a better-known hieratic script - not an alien language at all - and we've successfully deciphered it. The temple is dedicated to the "Waiting Worm" or the Worm-in-Waiting . Most of the inscriptions are sonorous, poetic invocations requesting its appearance or, if read in the other direction, its departure. There is also a body of inscriptions describing the "operations of the universe," which our more excitable archaeologist swears contains references to advanced field equations - nothing new to us, but very impressive for a temple of this vintage. We have yet to find a physicist who's prepared to go on record as agreeing that the references are meaningful, though. The temple holds no cosmic secrets or alien weapons, as far as we can tell. But its dark spaces have a distinctive, menacing beauty, and the poetry of the invocations to the Worm-in-Waiting becomes fashionable. They are set to popular music; they are published in collections.

## Optional events

Optional events can only take place after the initial event chain but before the Omega Alignment building has been constructed.

### Event: The Messenger:WHAT WAS, WILL BE

Evt space debris The [science ship name] has located a small, minimally powered artificial object, broadcasting a looping signal at local range only. These sorts of things usually turn out to be escape pods, and this looks like one of those. It's been out here a long time. When the crew cracks it open - carefully observing quarantine procedures - they find ancient remains, preserved by the sterile pod environment. So far, not unusual. The captain of the [science ship name] indicates, however, that they did not expect to find the [empire adjective] words WHAT WAS, WILL BE; WHAT WILL BE, WAS daubed on the wall in the bodily fluids of the pod's occupant - who the crew are now wryly referring to as the Messenger. They add that there are some equally unexpected anatomical similarities between the Messenger's species, and our own.

**Trigger conditions:** Doctrine: Strange Loop unlocked Omega Alignment not constructed

**Is triggered only by:** Entering any neutral system

 - Issue Special Project: Study the Messenger, and its message

### Event: The Messenger: Possibilities

Evt throne room We've established that the escape pod was the kind of commercially available knockoff common in the previous phase of galactic civilization - no new technologies or other insights. The remains of the Messenger, however, are another matter. It's unmistakably an ancestor or a variant of the [founder species adjective] species. Perhaps we have cousins out there - or perhaps we were subject to genetic manipulation by a precursor race. [scientist name] is requesting permission to conduct more extensive research.

### Event: The Messenger: Unleashed

Evt metropolis [scientist name] has reconstructed the Messenger species. It's feebler than ours, but has significantly improved cognitive abilities. There is some confusion about whether we were the source species, and the Messenger the modified version, or whether the Messenger was our ancestor. It is a little embarrassing to imagine that we might be descended from such an effete species - but [scientist name] is firmly of that opinion. Indeed, they consider the loss of cognitive abilities a "tragedy.". Such a tragedy that they have undergone a retroviral treatment to alter their own physiology to that of the Messengers. They insist that this will equip them much better to continue the project.

### Event: The Messenger: Leashed

Evt metropolis [scientist name] has reconstructed the Messenger. It's, ah, quite impressive - worryingly so. It seems to be considerably more robust and aggressive than our current edition. There is some confusion about whether we were the source species, and the Messenger the modified version, or whether the Messenger was our ancestor. [scientist name] is firmly of the former opinion - that we were once much more of a warrior species, and that some meddling precursor muzzled us genetically. Indeed, they consider the loss of our martial abilities a "tragedy." Such a tragedy that they have undergone a retroviral treatment to alter their own physiology to that of the Messengers. They insist that this will equip them much better to continue the project.

### Event: A Rendezvous

Evt metropolis The [fleet name]'s name is being hailed...by the Syzygy of [empire name]. This, despite the fact that it isn't sending any ID codes we recognize, and no ship of that name has ever been commissioned. The Syzygy's commanding officer claims to be Captain [commander name].

### Event: The Coils of God

Evt primitive civilization Our observation station on [planet name] reports the rise of an unusual minority religious-artistic movement, the Coils of God. Primitive mechanical clocks are considered holy, but ritually destroyed after a year's operation. The worm- and serpent-analogues of the planets are protected from harm. Time, the Coils-priests say, is a labyrinth. "What was, will be; what will be, was" they intone in their prayers.

### Event: The Coils of God: a Subtle Persecution

Evt primitive civilization We've convinced native rulers that the Coils of God cult on [planet name] is a threat. The Coils-priests have been discouraged, imprisoned, or, regrettably, incinerated. Pre-FTL species have access to a deep well of hatred and suspicion: there are times when that's very useful.

### Event: The Coils of God: Deep Roots

Evt primitive civilization We've convinced native rulers that the Coils of God cult on [planet name] is a threat. The Coils-priests have been discouraged, imprisoned, or, regrettably, incinerated. But the cult is tenacious, and our observers express concerns that it may just have gone underground.

### Event: The Coils of God: the Labyrinth Ceremonies

Evt primitive civilization The Coils of God cult on [planet name] has grown with unusual speed. It can be found in every city on the planet, and it's fostering a series of lengthy ceremonies conducted by citizens in every walk of life. The whole species has taken to them with unlikely enthusiasm. The rich adopt elaborate circular dances for their celebrations. The poor daub complex looping sigils on their doors. Even playground games are chants about the circular nature of time.

Evt primitive civilization Our campaign of subversion has disrupted the Coils of God ceremonies on [planet name]. The nobility abandon their cult. The looping graffiti on walls fades. The young return to playground games about flirtation, murder and other healthy childhood pastimes. There is a rash of suicides among Coils-priests. If there was a crisis, perhaps it is past.

Evt primitive civilization Our operatives are merciless. They abduct or assassinate every Coils-priest they can find. They set demolition charges on houses bearing the mark of the Loop. [planet name] is alive with rumors that the Coils' blasphemy has aroused the wrath of a greater god. Before long, the natives are beating the Coils-priests to death without any assistance from our operatives. The observation team is horrified; but if there was a crisis, it has been averted.

### Event: The Coils of God: Navigating the Labyrinth

Evt primitive civilization Our ethnographers are fascinated by the complexity of the ceremonies. They hypothesize secret communication channels, steganographic prayer-encodings, or algorithmic underpinnings to the rituals. In fact, they're returning preliminary evidence of this last when their communications abruptly cease. In fact, all communication seems to have ceased, planet-wide. Reports from satellites and survey craft flyovers confirm: there is no activity on the planet at all. No vehicles moving on the road, no emissions or thermal signatures in population centers. No signs of life... And here's the final report. The entire [primitive species name] population of the planet - including your ethnography team - is absent, with all the business of a sudden but not violent exit. Meals were left unfinished, pets unfed, the occasional house aflame from an unattended stove. Gravitational anomalies were recorded at the assumed time of departure. In almost every street, the looped chalk sigils of the Coils bear witness.

### Event: The Waiting World

Evt colony settlement It appears this was not the first [founder species name] settlement on this planet. A number of facilities and residences have been carefully moth-balled and, with a little restoration, will serve our new colony well. But all records have been erased. Possibly this was a smugglers' port, or a haven for political exiles.

### Event: The Waiting World: Demolition

Evt colony settlement Our engineers set charges and retire to a safe distance. The buildings are reduced to ruins. Eventually, the ruins will crack and crumble to boulders, pebbles, dust, under the assault of wind, roots, rain. But their shell will endure for centuries yet; and there will be stories, we'll hear, of shadows in the stone by day, blue lights by night. Our colonists will avoid them. They'll attract no visitors.

### Event: The Waiting World: Shadows in the walls

Evt colony settlement Our settlers were initially happy to make use the buildings on [colony name]. Their existence jump-started the colony. But now they've grown nervous. There are rumors that the buildings may still have occupants, or active security systems, although no evidence of either has been found. Some colonists insist, enigmatically, that there are "shadows in the walls."

### Event: The Waiting World: Too Many

Evt colony settlement Interesting news from [colony name], where we found those abandoned buildings. A census shows too many settlers. Records on a new colony are always unreliable, but as far as we can tell they have authentic citizen IDs - and no-one on the world has suggested there are any mysterious strangers. But the birth rate must have been extraordinarily high, or we have unlicensed migration, or... something. Somehow, the population is higher than we might reasonably expect.

Evt colony settlement Another update from [colony name], where we found those abandoned buildings. The number of colonists continues to increase, and now we're finding irregularities in the records - family groups that shouldn't exist, birth dates that make no sense. There must be secret migration from a lost colony, or else some peculiar sabotage by the colonists.

### Event: The Waiting World: Everyone Is

Evt colony settlement Further unlikely news from [colony name], where the population had been mysteriously increasing. Population numbers are now what we'd expect, but there has been some sort of information sabotage, or... or what, our administrators aren't really sure. None of the individuals on the planet exists in our records. Every original colonist is missing. It's as if they've all been replaced by complete strangers. As against that, they all swear they're loyal citizens of [empire name]. They're all productive and apparently sane. In all communications they deny all knowledge of any confusion, and insist there must be a mistake at our end.

**Trigger conditions:** Existing Loop-Plowed Farm and Spiral-Hewn Mine planetary features 75% chance

### Event: The Waiting World: Everything and Nothing

Evt colony settlement Our team reports that the population of the planet are healthy, normal and apparently bewildered by all the fuss. There are some peculiarities, though. An unusual number of multiple births; a planet-wide idiosyncrasy where no-one has any regard for punctuality; and fluctuations in local solar radiation that are characteristic of pre-supernova stars. They also observe a number of "luminosity events" on the surface where light somehow appears to be accumulated and released by prismatic functions of the atmosphere. This is valuable and peculiar data. But it could be coincidental. If anything has happened to the colonists, it remains a mystery.

Evt colony settlement Our team reports that [planet name] is, indeed, empty - not only of colonists, but of any sign the colony was ever there. The buildings are gone, the satellites and orbital structures are gone, the atmosphere shows none of the footprints of technological civilization. In the words of the team, it's as if the entire planet has been reset. They also report fluctuations in local solar radiation that are characteristic of pre-supernova stars - and a number of "luminosity events" on the surface where light somehow appears to be accumulated and released by prismatic functions of the atmosphere. This is valuable and peculiar data. But it doesn't clarify the fate of the colonists.

## Omega Alignment events

Entropic Recursion and Doctrine: Strange Loop are prerequisite for a rare technology called the Omega Theory. Researching it grants access to a unique building, the Omega Alignment, that can only be built on the empire capital to bring the end of the event chain.

### Event: The End in the Beginning

Evt metropolis

There is a consciousness outside time and beneath space. It is a labyrinthine tangle of desire and desperation. Our remote ancestors knew it as the Loop, the Worm-in-Waiting. We have met it out there, where the void is tormented by gravity. It seems to have taken a personal interest in us. There are mathematical proofs that it loves us, but love to the Worm is not like love to anything that subsists in ordinary space. With all we have learned, we think that we might be able to use the Omega Alignment to open an access route - an Entry Point - for the Worm to manifest in our home system. (The Worm is fond of beginnings, and this is ours.) What consequences would that have? We have yet to find anyone who's prepared to commit to an answer. Immortality, perhaps, or apocalypse. But we would certainly learn a great deal.

**Trigger conditions:**

**Is triggered only by:** Constructing the Omega Alignment building

### Event: The Heart of the Sun

Evt dimensional horror

The Project is complete. The accelerators are online. The power network of a dozen cities is diverted to wake the pseudo-singularity at the heart of the Alignment. Space shudders like wind-wracked cloth. [star name], for a heart-stopping moment, dims, and then brightens. A shadow coils in its heart. The Worm is here. It unfolds like origami. Across the system, sensors shut down in abject disbelief as the incomprehensible data of its arrival sleets through them. On the homeworld, our subjects scream and cower as they feel its attention turned up on them, and upon us. It presents a wordless question - or rather, we have become aware that this question was always what it was asking us, every time we encountered it.

### Event: The Future

Evt black hole

The Worm loves us. It will always love us, and thus it always has. It winds around the hot heart of our home star. It winds around every infinitesimal loop of genetic information. It provokes a shuddering series of cataclysms in the planetary crust of our home, but when our star grows cold, that cataclysm will warm us. We understand so much more. We will always be what we were going to be, wound tight in the love of the Worm.

**Trigger conditions:** The Heart of the Sun

### Event: The Shattered Loop

Evt crisis defeated

The Worm came in through the boundary fences of spacetime like a hungry predator, or a jilted and furious lover. It's still out there, and wherever it is, no doubt it's angry. But you have the incandescent shards of its avatar to hoard and to study, as a cosmic trophy. Other empires will know what you have achieved today.

# Mass Extinction Through the Ages

Mass Extinction Through the Ages is one of the 4 story event chains that can take place very early, having a 10% chance to occur. Unlike the other 3 event chains, Mass Extinction Through the Ages is focused entirely on exploration. Each Special Project requires a science ship and takes 60 days to complete.

### Event: Mass Extinction

Evt board meeting

Our first steps into the void beyond [homeworld name] were driven not just by curiosity or conquest but by necessity. The biosphere of [homeworld name] has rapidly changed, with scientists warning of a potential mass extinction event, a cyclical purging of life inherent to planetary existence in the cosmos. A research plan has been developed to study planets rendered uninhabitable by major astronomical incidents. By reconstructing these events, we hope to avoid a similar fate for [homeworld name] and the [species name] race.

**Trigger conditions:** Not Gestalt Consciousness Not Hard Reset Not Life-Seeded Not Shattered Ring Not Void Dwellers Not Broken Shackles Not Payback

**Mean time to happen:** Time 490 days

 - Adds 5 systems 1-8 hyperlanes away as points of interest in the Situation Log

### Event: Mass Extinction: Broken Planet

Evt mining station

Our astronomers are confident that the asteroid belt in this system was once a habitable planet, torn asunder by unknown forces. A Special Project has been issued to study one of the major asteroids in the belt.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the Broken Planet point of interest system

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Issue Special Project: Analysis: Broken

### Event: Mass Extinction: Burned Planet

Evt satellite in orbit

One of the planets orbiting this star bears the still-open wounds of some past calamity. Its surface is a roiling sea of half-melted minerals boiling into a superheated atmosphere, but [founder species adjective] astronomers claim that it may once have supported life. A Special Project has been issued to study the molten planet.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the Burned Planet point of interest system

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Issue Special Project: Analysis: Burned

### Event: Mass Extinction: Desolate Planet

Evt underground civilization

A planet in this system still wears the fossilized traces of a past ecology on its sleeve. What could turn a thriving biosphere into a blasted wasteland? A Special Project has been issued to trace the source of this disastrous transformation.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the Desolate Planet point of interest system

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Issue Special Project: Analysis: Desolate

### Event: Mass Extinction: Noxious Planet

Evt alien nature

Allegedly this planet's flora and fauna choked on their own poisonous emissions, likely helped along by the release of reactive gases from beneath the planet's crust. A Special Project has been issued to investigate the matter.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the Noxious Planet point of interest system

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Issue Special Project: Analysis: Noxious

### Event: Mass Extinction: Chilly Planet

The planet of interest in this system is covered in layer upon layer of dense ices of varying composition. Apparently it was once home to more varied and pleasant biomes. A Special Project has been issued to investigate this possibility.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the Chilly Planet point of interest system

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Issue Special Project: Analysis: Chilly

### Event: Mass Extinction: Asteroid

Evt mining station

The asteroid is in actuality a chunk of what was once a habitable, and probably inhabited, planet. Regular but overlapping fracture patterns indicate that the planetary demolition was intentional and controlled, if somewhat rushed. All signs point to this planet being the homeworld of whatever species destroyed it. We may never know what drove them to consider planetary annihilation to be the lesser evil, and perhaps we should be grateful for that.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction: Broken Planet

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Analysis: Broken special project

- **Option:** **OK**
 - If Grand Archive is installed gain the Fractured Planet specimen

### Event: Mass Extinction: Molten

Evt satellite in orbit

The unfortunate fate of the planet can be laid squarely at the feet of cosmic whims. Some gravitational disturbance (after eying the system's sun with some suspicion, our scientists named a transient space-time anomaly as the likely culprit) forced the planet from its natural orbit to one much too close to the sun. Although the planet is slowly spiraling out towards its original orbit, it has been cooking in the residual heat from the star ever since.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction: Burned Planet

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Analysis: Burned special project

- **Option:** **OK**
 - If Grand Archive is installed gain the Molten Planetary Slag specimen

### Event: Mass Extinction: Barren

Evt underground civilization

Life on the now-barren planet was, sadly, doomed from the start. As if by some cruel stellar conspiracy, the dominant species on the planet barely had time to awaken to sapience and invent agriculture before, through unfortunate geological mechanisms, the earth started turning sour. Samples from lower soil strata and the fossilized remains of the creatures that once roamed the planet show that several vital minerals needed to rejuvenate the soil ended up, through their largely agricultural diet, in the endoskeletons of the native beings. Their bones were prone to fossilize rather than decay, and their very existence exhausted the fragile ecosystem they inhabited, leaving it permanently transformed in the wake of their passing.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction: Desolate Planet

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Analysis: Desolate special project

- **Option:** **OK**
 - If Grand Archive is installed gain the Fossilized Endoskeletons specimen

### Event: Mass Extinction: Toxic

Evt alien nature

The cracks in the [planet or moon]'s crust, first presumed to be the result of significant tectonic activity, are actually the lasting marks of impossibly large roots, burrowing through the earth. At some point in the distant past, a freak mutation - possibly deliberately induced by sapient beings, though it is unlikely they could have predicted the result - caused the native plant life to grow out of control. Many of these plants reproduce through pollination, with countless gametes carried by currents through the lower atmosphere. While this process was originally only cause for mild irritation, the exponential increase in atmosphere-borne particles effectively choked the life out of all animals on the planet in a matter of months.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction: Noxious Planet

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Analysis: Noxious special project

- **Option:** **OK**

### Event: Mass Extinction: Frozen

Evt outpost

An unnatural shift in the atmosphere's chemical make-up resulted in the slow onset of an ice age, beginning before the formation of [empire name] and likely persisting long after our passing. The exact cause is unknown, but possible explanations include failed terraforming attempts or even intra-planetary terrorism. Some radical elements within the scientific community on [capital name] suggest that the climate shift may have been caused by the unchecked emission of gaseous industrial by-products. This view is confined to the fringe, as it is unlikely any race intelligent enough for industrialization would be foolish enough to wipe themselves out.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction: Chilly Planet Not Relentless Industrialists

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Analysis: Chilly special project

- **Option:** **OK**

### Event: Mass Extinction: Frozen

Evt outpost

An unnatural shift in the atmosphere's chemical make-up resulted in the slow but irreversible onset of an ice age - one that began before the formation of the [empire name] and is likely to persist long after our passing. The cause appears familiar from our experience of industrialization on our own planets: the unchecked emission of gaseous industrial by-product into the atmosphere caused dramatic climatic shifts which they lacked the technology to counteract. This conclusion has caused some concern among our scientific community, although most point out that at our technological level such an extinction event could "probably" be avoided.

**Trigger conditions:** Mass Extinction: Chilly Planet Relentless Industrialists

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Analysis: Chilly special project

- **Option:** **OK**

### Event: Mass Extinction: Study Complete

Evt metropolis

While the research expedition often yielded unexpected results, [founder species adjective] scientists now have access to an unprecedented wealth of data with which to accurately model the future of [capital name]. Initial reports suggest that [capital name] will be in no real danger for at least a dozen generations, save from freak cosmic events or the violent collapse of the [empire name].

# Radical Cult

Radical Cult is one of the 4 story event chains that can take place very early. It has few rewards but grants a unique ship at the end of the event chain. The event chain has a 10% chance to take place, increased to 20% if the empire is Spiritualist and decreased to 5% if the empire is Materialist.

The Radical Cult will always have one of the following names:

- The Church of Light
- The Fellowship
- The Final Crucible
- The Fist of God
- The Grey Disciples
- The Penitent Ones
- The Red Prophets
- The Temple of Unity
- The Throne of God
- The True Path

Answering to the first event can be postponed if there is not sufficient Unity.

### Event: Radical Cult

Evt alien propaganda

Centuries ago, a group of radical priests and their devoted followers on [capital name] broke away from the established religions to form their own church. These extremists called themselves the [random name], and have been responsible for many atrocities and acts of terror over the years. Although they have kept a low profile in modern times, we recently learned that many of their agents have infiltrated our military. These renegades have secretly been diverting resources to the construction of a small fleet of starships at a hidden facility on [capital name]! When their treachery was revealed, the cultists blasted into orbit on their ships and fled to [random planet in home system].

**Trigger conditions:** Not Gestalt Consciousness Not Hard Reset Not Broken Shackles Not Payback Not Eager Explorers Not Privatized Exploration

**Mean time to happen:** Time 490 days

- **Option:** **They must be stopped!**
 - A hostile fleet of 3 corvettes appears in the home system
- **Option:** **We can learn to forgive them.**
 - −125
 - Gain a fleet of 3 corvettes led by a level 2 Commander with the Crusader II trait

### Event: Cultist Flagship Transferred

Evt ship travel

A former member of the [radical cult name], now fully committed to our cause, has convinced their old comrades to abandon their fanaticism and join our ranks. Their flagship now orbits [homeworld name], awaiting inspection before its formal induction into our navy.

**Trigger conditions:** Radical Cult Paid Unity 20% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 360 days

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Gain control of a battleship with Tier 2 components

### Event: Cultist Ship Disabled

Evt sabotaged ship

Our valiant space forces have skillfully disabled a ship in the cultist armada! It is mostly intact and we are picking up faint life signs from inside its hull. Once we have eliminated all threats in the immediate vicinity, we should conduct a boarding operation to secure any survivors. They may be able to tell us more about the ultimate motives of the [radical cult name].

**Trigger conditions:** Radical Cult Did not pay Unity

**Is triggered only by:** Defeating the cultist fleet

- **Option:** **Prepare the breaching charges!**
 - Issue Special Project: Board Cultist Ship

### Event: Boarding Action

Evt interior battle

Though the survivors offered stiff resistance, our boarding party was able to secure several prisoners from the disabled cultist starship. From them we have learned that this conspiracy goes far deeper than we initially suspected - the agents of the [radical cult name] include several flag officers and high-ranking officials within our government! Mass arrests are being made on [capital name], and all assets belonging to this cult have been seized. However, several of the starships they built in secret remain unaccounted for and the upper echelons of the cult's leadership have vanished. We have picked up faint ion trails leading to several outlying systems.

**Trigger conditions:** Cultist Ship Disabled

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Board Cultist Ship special project

- **Option:** **We must pursue these terrorists!**
 - Adds 3 systems 1-5 hyperlanes away as points of interest in the Situation Log
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the [radical cult name] Pendant specimen

### Event: Cultist Marauders Encountered

Evt space battle

We have sighted ships flying the flag of the [radical cult name] in the [current system name] system. They have charged their weapons and are moving to intercept us!

**Trigger conditions:** Boarding Action

**Is triggered only by:** Entering a point of interest system

- **Option:** **Battlestations!**
 - A hostile fleet of 3 corvettes appears in the current system

### Event: Cultist Marauders Encountered

Evt space battle

Yet another cultist fleet loyal to the [radical cult name] has been sighted in the [current system name] system. This time, however, their numbers include a strange ship of an unfamiliar design!

**Trigger conditions:** Boarding Action

**Is triggered only by:** Entering a point of interest system

- **Option:** **Battlestations!**
 - A hostile fleet of 3 corvettes and 1 battleship appears in the current system

### Event: Cultist Marauders Encountered

Evt space battle

More ships belonging to the [radical cult name] have been encountered in the [current system name] system. They are approaching in attack formation!

**Trigger conditions:** Boarding Action

**Is triggered only by:** Entering a point of interest system

- **Option:** **Battlestations!**
 - A hostile fleet of 4 corvettes appears in the current system

### Event: Cultist Fleet Destroyed

Evt exploding ship

The cultist fleet operating in the [current system name] system has been destroyed in battle.

**Trigger conditions:** Cultist Marauders Encountered

**Is triggered only by:** Defeating any cultist fleet

- **Option:** **Good.**

### Event: Battle Debris

Evt exploding ship

We have defeated the cultist forces encountered so far, but these engagements have raised a number of alarming questions. The [radical cult name] has been deploying far more ships than they could possibly have built in secrecy on [capital name], and now they pitted a large warship of an unknown design against us. Where are these ships coming from? Are there more warships like the one we just destroyed? We should investigate the battle debris for answers.

**Trigger conditions:** Cultist Fleet Destroyed

**Is triggered only by:** Defeating the last cultist fleet

- **Option:** **Begin recovery efforts.**
 - Issue Special Project: Cultist Warship Debris

### Event: Recovery Efforts Completed

Evt space station

After sifting through the debris left by the strange cultist warship we destroyed, our scientists believe they may have divined the source of the ships the [radical cult name] has been throwing against us. Fragments from a log file mention some kind of abandoned alien shipyard discovered by the cultist ships fleeing [capital system star name]. They have been using the automated shipyard to reinforce their numbers, and now they are even producing new ships from alien templates found within the station's memory banks! This cannot be allowed to continue.

**Trigger conditions:** Battle Debris

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Cultist Warship Debris special project

- **Option:** **That shipyard must be destroyed!**
 - A space station and a fleet of 3 corvettes and a battleship appear in an unsurveyed system. That system is added as point of interest in the Situation Log.

### Event: Shipyard Destroyed

Evt exploding ship

The alien shipyard that was used by the [radical cult name] in their crusade against us has been destroyed! Some of the cultists were captured when their escape pods were picked up by our forces, including their chief engineer. His knowledge of the shipyard's advanced technology has proved quite valuable. Unfortunately, we have also learned that the cult's charismatic leader departed the shipyard several weeks ago on her new flagship - a more powerful variant of the alien ships they produced. Military intelligence is working on pinpointing the location of this vessel.

**Trigger conditions:** Recovery Efforts Completed

**Is triggered only by:** Destroying the cultist space station

- **Option:** **She will be found!**
 - Engineering Research Gained: 120-350
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the [radical cult name] Shipyard Schematics specimen

### Event: Shipyard Destroyed

Evt exploding ship

Someone has destroyed the alien shipyard that was being used by the [radical cult name] in their crusade against us. Preliminary reports indicate that the cultist forces were thoroughly wiped out, but we have also received intelligence that the cult's charismatic leader left the shipyard on her new flagship moments before the battle had begun. She is still at large somewhere in the galaxy. Military intelligence is working on pinpointing the exact location of her flagship.

**Trigger conditions:** Recovery Efforts Completed

**Is triggered only by:** Another empire destroying the cultist space station

- **Option:** **She will be found!**

### Event: Probable Cultist Flagship Locations

Evt ship in orbit

Deep space reconnaissance probes have picked up faint subspace emissions in a star system consistent with the drive signatures of the alien ships used by the [radical cult name]. The cult's missing flagship is the most probable source! We should send forces to search this system as soon as possible. That ship and its charismatic master are too dangerous to leave at large.

**Trigger conditions:** Shipyard Destroyed

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 months

- **Option:** **Ready the fleet.**
 - A fleet of 5 corvettes and a battleship appears in an unsurveyed system. That system is added as point of interest in the Situation Log

### Event: Flagship Disabled

Evt interior battle

Our forces have managed to disable the flagship of the [radical cult name]! Its weapons and engines are no longer functional, but life support systems remain stable. We should prepare for a boarding action. Due to the large number of armed cultists within the ship, a significant number of troops will be necessary to secure it.

**Trigger conditions:** Probable Cultist Flagship Location

**Is triggered only by:** Defeating the cultist fleet

- **Option:** **That ship will be ours!**
 - Issue Special Project: Board Cultist Flagship

### Event: Cultist Flagship Destroyed

Evt interior battle

Someone else recently defeated the cultist flagship after a pitched battle in the [point of interest system name] system. Our admirals have expressed regret over the fact that our own forces were unable to deliver the killing blow, but at least this should signify the end of this malignant cult and its campaign of terror.

**Trigger conditions:** Probable Cultist Flagship Location

**Is triggered only by:** Another empire defeating the cultist fleet

- **Option:** **Good.**

### Event: Cultist Flagship Secured

Evt interior battle

After slowly fighting their way deck by deck, our marines have finally eradicated the last pockets of resistance on the former flagship of the [radical cult name]. Few prisoners were taken as most of the zealous cultists preferred to throw their lives away in futile suicide attacks. The cult's leader was found on the vessel's bridge, killed by her own hand. At long last, it looks like the [radical cult name] has met its end. Our engineers have restored power to the ship's engines, and it has been pressed into service with our fleet as the [random name]. The vessel should be brought to a spaceport as soon as possible for more permanent repairs.

**Trigger conditions:** Flagship Disabled

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Board Cultist Flagship special project

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Gain control of a battleship with Tier 2 components
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the [radical cult name] Unfinished Manifesto specimen


# Sublight Exploration Probes

Sublight Exploration Probes is one of the 4 story event chains that can take place very early, having a 10% chance to occur. Unlike the other 3 event chains Sublight Exploration Probes requires waiting a year rather than a few days to start, and is only story event chain also available to Gestalt Consciousness.

This event chain cannot occur for empires with the Hard Reset, Broken Shackles or Payback origin.

### Event: Sublight Exploration Probes

Evt satellite in orbit Before we developed faster-than-light travel, several sublight exploration probes were dispatched from [capital name] at near-relativistic speeds towards nearby systems. The scientists who developed the probes naively included sensitive information about our culture in their memory cores as a form of greeting to alien civilizations. It has now been realized that this data could potentially be used against us. We need to track down these probes before they are found by someone - or something - unsympathetic to our species!

**Trigger conditions:** Discovered alien life

**Mean time to happen:** Time 820 days

- **Option:** **They can't have gotten far.**
 - Adds 4 systems 2-6 hyperlanes away as points of interest in the Situation Log

### Event: Sublight Probe Discovered

Evt satellite in orbit [science ship name] has detected one of our missing sublight probes in the [current system name] system. We should begin recovery efforts as soon as possible.

**Trigger conditions:** Sublight Exploration Probes

**Is triggered only by:** Entering a point of interest system

- **Option:** **Indeed.**
 - Issue Special Project: Recover Probe

### Event: Modified Probe

Evt satellite in orbit A sensor sweep from the [science ship name] has revealed one of our sublight probes in the [current system name] system, but it seems to have been... altered somehow. Modifications of an alien origin have been attached to its hull, and the probe's energy signature is far greater than it should be. We are receiving a transmission from it!

**Trigger conditions:** Sublight Exploration Probes

**Is triggered only by:** Entering a point of interest system

- **Option:** **On screen.**
 - Modified Probe becomes hostile

### Event: Subspace Anomaly

Evt satellite in orbit The [science ship name] has detected a massive subspace anomaly in the [current system name] system. It appears to be centered on one of our missing sublight probes!

**Trigger conditions:** Sublight Exploration Probes

**Is triggered only by:** Entering a point of interest system

- **Option:** **We must proceed with caution.**
 - A Void Cloud appears above the sublight probe

### Event: Probe Recovered

Evt satellite in orbit We have recovered the sublight probe in the [current system name] system. The sensor telemetry it has collected over the years has provided us with a complete survey of all planetary bodies within the system

**Trigger conditions:** Sublight Probe Discovered

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Recover Probe special project

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - The point of interest system is surveyed

### Event: Probe Destroyed

Evt satellite in orbit Little remains of the strange alien modifications that our missing sublight probe had been subjected to, but we did manage to collect some valuable engineering data from the wreckage. Its memory bank was also salvaged, and from it we have extracted survey data of the entire [current system name] system.

**Trigger conditions:** Modified Probe

**Is triggered only by:** Defeating the Modified Probe

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Engineering Research Gained: 90-10000
 - The point of interest system is surveyed
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the Zombie Probe specimen

### Event: Anomaly Defeated

Evt satellite in orbit We have dealt with the hostile subspace entity that our missing probe had attracted. Why such a creature would be drawn to an archaic unmanned spacecraft is a mystery, but the probe appears to be largely undamaged. It has been recovered by our forces, and we have extracted detailed survey readings on the entire [current system name] from its memory banks. In addition, the residual energy left behind by the subspace anomaly has generated a large amount of valuable physics data for our scientists.

**Trigger conditions:** Subspace Anomaly

**Is triggered only by:** Defeating the Void Cloud

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Physics Research Gained: 90-10000
 - The point of interest system is surveyed

### Event: Ion Trail

Evt satellite in orbit The [science ship name] has picked up a signal from a discarded signal buoy belonging to one of our missing sublight probes in the [current system name] system. There is an ion trail leading away from the buoy on a trajectory towards another star, suggesting that someone has towed the probe there for unknown reasons.

**Trigger conditions:** Sublight Exploration Probes

**Is triggered only by:** Entering a point of interest system

- **Option:** **Let us see where the trail leads.**
 - Adds another system as point of interest in the Situation Log

### Event: Probes Collected

Evt satellite in orbit We have successfully collected all of our missing sublight probes! The detailed information they held on our culture is now safe from prying alien photoreceptors. With their combined sensor telemetry, we have been able to fully survey a number of additional neighboring systems.

**Trigger conditions:** Sublight Exploration Probes

**Is triggered only by:** Collecting all 4 probes

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Physics Research Gained: 90-10000
 - Energy Credits Gained: 100-500
 - All systems neighboring the capital are surveyed


# Wanderlust: Rogue Scientist

Wanderlust is one of the 4 story event chains that can take place very early. It is extremely rare, having only a 1% chance of taking place in a game. The event chain is completely linear, each event leading only to the next until the event chain is over. This event chain cannot occur for Gestalt Consciousness empires.

### Event: Wanderlust

Evt hangar bay The Head of the [empire name]'s Research Department has gone missing. Along with their privately-funded, highly experimental prototype Science Ship. The incident has the scientific community on [capital name] in an uproar.

**Trigger conditions:** Not Gestalt Consciousness

**Mean time to happen:** Time 460 days

- **Option:** **How odd.**
 - Head of Research disappears

### Event: Wanderlust: With Purpose

Evt ship in orbit The whereabouts of the Head - now technically the former Head of Research - have yet to be ascertained. Certain details regarding the prototype Science Ship and the Head's private research have reached our ears, and while some aspects seem too fantastical to be true, it is clear that it is in the [empire name]'s interest to find and recover the Chair as soon as possible. The Situation Log has been updated.

**Trigger conditions:** Wanderlust

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 days

- **Option:** **Very well.**
 - Adds 3 systems 1-5 hyperlanes away as points of interest in the Situation Log

### Event: Wanderlust: Dead End

Evt ship in orbit The Department Head is not in this system. Either the lead was a dud, or the trail has gone cold.

**Trigger conditions:** Wanderlust: With Purpose

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the first two point of interest systems

- **Option:** **We will keep looking.**

### Event: Wanderlust: The Drones

Evt ship in orbit The Chair has vanished, inexplicably, yet again. However, they did leave a number of drones behind, as promised. The drones are armed, and their weapons are powering up!

**Trigger conditions:** Wanderlust: Dead End

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the last point of interest systems

- **Option:** **Battlestations!**
 - 2 hostile Ancient Mining Drones appear above the system's star

### Event: Wanderlust: The Drones Destroyed

Evt ship in orbit The drones' IFF modules had been removed, likely a result of the Head Researcher's repairs, but their threat assessment processors remained intact and somewhat stressed by the Head's invasive procedures. It is unlikely that the head meant for the drones to attack us, but fact remains that they covered the scientist's escape nicely. Consult the Situation Log for a Special Project to track the Head from their last known location.

**Trigger conditions:** Wanderlust: The Drones

**Is triggered only by:** Defeating the Ancient Mining Drones fleet

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Issue Special Project: What Was Left Behind

### Event: Wanderlust: Special Project Completed

Evt ship in orbit Having decoded the intricate web of energy signatures left behind by the Chair's elusive Science Ship, we are on their trail once again. Consult the Situation Log for details.

**Trigger conditions:** Wanderlust: The Drones Destroyed

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the What Was Left Behind special project

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Adds a system 3-8 hyperlanes away as point of interest in the Situation Log

### Event: Wanderlust: The Blinds

Evt ship in orbit A quick check confirms the Head's claims, and the [empire name] has enjoyed a small but not insignificant boost to our collective body of physics research. The Researcher has vanished once again, but this time their course had been divined before they were even out of the system. If they are headed for this Window, then so are we. Consult the Situation Log for details.

**Trigger conditions:** Wanderlust: Special Project Completed

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the The Hunt Continues point of interest system

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Physics Research Gained: 350-100000
 - Adds a system 3-8 hyperlanes away as point of interest in the Situation Log

### Event: Wanderlust: The Window Closes

Evt wormhole The Science Ship is empty. All suits for extra-vehicular activity remain in their pods, and the ship logs state that the airlock has never been exit-cycled. The ship still orbits the star, but is now under [founder species adjective] control.

**Trigger conditions:** Wanderlust: The Blinds

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the The Window point of interest system

- **Option:** **An unnerving end.**
 - Gain a Science Ship
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the Ethereal Dust specimen


# The Hunt for the Hyacinth

The Hunt for the Hyacinth is a short and linear event chain available only to the **Commonwealth of Man** preset empire. It will start as soon as the game starts and is entirely optional. It is mostly narrative, with only the final event having a minor reward.

### Event: The Hunt for the Hyacinth

Evt star chart We have found no traces of the four ark ships that passed through the wormhole before the Chrysanthemum arrived at Unity. One ship, the Hyacinth, was scheduled to make the passage after us, and the Chrysanthemum's long-range sensors reported a brief energy spike from the wormhole shortly before it destabilized and vanished. Assuming the Hyacinth survived the passage and made it to our galactic neighborhood, the ark ship has so far failed to establish contact with us. It might be a good idea to search nearby systems for signs of its presence.

**Trigger conditions:** Playing as the Commonwealth of Man preset empire

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1 day

- **Option:** **Indeed. Make it so.**
 - Point of interest: Survey Systems
- **Option:** **A wild goose chase we can ill afford.**

### Event: System Surveyed

Evt star chart The [science ship name] has managed to isolate a residual ion trail in the [system name] system that is identical to the one that was produced by the Chrysanthemum's engines. It must have originated from the Hyacinth! Although the faint ion trail is over a century old, Science Officer [scientist name] has managed to track it on an outbound trajectory towards a previously uncharted star. We have entered its coordinates into the Situation Log.

**Trigger conditions:** The Hunt for the Hyacinth

**Is triggered only by:** Surveying the correct point of interest system

- **Option:** **The Hyacinth must be there.**
 - Point of interest: Investigate System

### Event: Hyacinth Found

Evt ship in orbit We have located the Hyacinth! The great ark ship is parked in a stable orbit over [planet name]. No power signatures have been detected from within its hull, and we are not picking up any distress beacons. An armed boarding party should be sent to investigate the ship's interior.

**Trigger conditions:** System Surveyed

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the point of interest system

- **Option:** **Gear up.**
 - Issue Special Project: Board the Hyacinth

### Event: Hyacinth Boarded

Evt hangar bay Our boarding party has returned from the Hyacinth with a gruesome report. Human remains in amounts consistent with the ark ship's entire compliment of a quarter million colonists were found on board. Most seem to have died from starvation, but there were also signs of small-arms fire and cannibalism... We were able to recover the captain's log from the archives on the Hyacinth's bridge.

**Trigger conditions:** Hyacinth Found

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Board the Hyacinth special project

- **Option:** **Bring it up.**
 - Displays a log of what happened to the Hyacinth
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the Figurehead of the Hyacinth specimen

### Event: Final Conclusion

Evt throne room We now have a pretty clear picture of the grim fate that befell the Hyacinth, her crew and the colonists she was carrying. Had circumstances been different, it could very well have been the Chrysanthemum drifting above [planet name] like a silent tomb. A sobering reminder of the dangers humanity is faced with in a cold and uncaring universe. The Hyacinth will now be towed into low orbit of Unity and converted into a museum, as soon as the human remains have been cleared out. Despite its tragic history, the ark ship is almost identical to the one that brought our ancestors here from Earth and our sociologists could learn much from it.

**Trigger conditions:** Hyacinth Boarded

**Is triggered only by:** Closing the log

- **Option:** **Perhaps something good will come out of this.**
 - Society Research Gained: 500-100000

# Fountain of Youth

Fountain of Youth is an event chain that can only happen to empires that own a Science Nexus megastructure. It can only happen once per game.

### Event: Fountain of Youth

Evt Science Nexus

The board of the Science Nexus are thrilled to announce that they have been given a unique opportunity to recruit widely acclaimed researcher Dr. Xhaxxore, a prominent name within the field of life-extension. He and his staff were in the final stages of developing a serum that has shown good promise of prolonging life, when they ran out of funds. Hiring Dr. Xhaxxore however, means we will not have the resources to continue our current research into organic engineering, led by Dr. Groik. She is attempting to streamline engineering research with the use of an organic supercomputer.

**Trigger conditions:** Not Gestalt Consciousness Not Mechanical founder species 16.5% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 10 years

- **Option:** **Recruit Dr. Xhaxxore for 1000 credits.**
 - −1000
- **Option:** **Prioritize Dr. Groik's research.**

### Event: Suspicious Minds

Evt Science Nexus

Dr. Xhaxxore and his team demonstrated the results from their research earlier this week. The serum, when applied to the skin, causes unprecedented cell regeneration, supposedly thanks to the miracle ingredient, "essence of [alien species name]", named after its mysterious origin. Sadly, there have been complaints from a few individuals regarding the additional funding Xhaxxore received. Dr. Groik has even gone so far as to accuse Xhaxxore of being a fraud. Now she requests permission, as well as an additional budget of 500 credits, to launch a secret investigation. If Xhaxxore finds out he might take offense and leave.

**Trigger conditions:** Fountain of Youth Paid Energy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 2 months

- **Option:** **Investigate, to be on the safe side.**
 - −500
- **Option:** **There's nothing to back her claims.**

### Event: Neural Bank

Evt Science Nexus

Dr. Groik and her team have invented a neural bank - an organic computer that stores and harnesses the collective cognitive power of all brains that are uploaded to its drive, greatly improving our research speed. But there's one hitch - to function properly, the uploaded brains have to be extracted from the subjects' bodies and placed within a tank of conductive fluids. Since our bodies can not survive long without a brain, subjects will have to leave their material existence behind. As expected, volunteers have not been lining up. So far there has been only one - science leader [scientist name].

**Trigger conditions:** Fountain of Youth Did not pay Energy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 2 months

- **Option:** **Upload [scientist name]'s brain to the Nexus.**
 - Science Nexus is upgraded to Stage IV (Groik Nexus)
 - A scientist dies ( Head of Research if empire has one)
- **Option:** **That would be unethical.**
- **Option:** **No, [scientist name] is needed elsewhere.**

### Event: Essence of [alien species homeworld]

Evt Science Nexus

Dr. Groik's investigation into Xhaxxore's research has yielded some interesting results. Not only has Dr. Xhaxxore greatly exaggerated the effects of the serum, he has neglected to mention that they are only temporary. The side-effects, however, when over-used, can be quite permanent. The essence itself has been extracted from a gland found in a species native to the [alien species homeworld] system, none other than the [alien species name] of the [alien empire name]. Xhaxxore has held several [alien species plural] in cryostasis for months to secure the necessary supply of essence. It is likely that our diplomatic ties with their empire would suffer if they were to discover the truth.

**Trigger conditions:** Suspicious Minds Paid Energy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 2 months

- **Option:** **Terminate the project and apprehend Xhaxxore. No one can know.**
- **Option:** **Silence Groik and market the product as anti-aging cream.**

### Event: The Essence of Nothing

Evt Science Nexus

Xhaxxore is gone and he's taken all his research with him, leaving only his bewildered staff behind. They were as blindsided by his sudden disappearance as we were, and though all attest to the content of his character, painting a portrait of a charismatic and charitable genius who would do anything for his team, they could only offer anecdotal evidence of his achievements. We can only speculate as to whether Dr. Groik was right to call him a fraud, or whether he took his miracle essence to a higher bidder. If he ever tries a similar scheme elsewhere, we will find him.

**Trigger conditions:** Suspicious Minds Did not pay Energy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 2 months

- **Option:** **Scoundrel!**

### Event: Fountain of Youth

Evt Science Nexus

Regrettably the mysterious Dr. Xhaxxore has slipped through our clutches, leaving his staff and test-subjects behind. The [alien species plural] have been awoken and thankfully have no recollection of what they've been through. As for Xhaxxore he is probably already on his way to some distant system, under a different name, plotting his next con. With a little luck, the next time he slips up we will be there to catch him. His disgraced staff seem to have been as blindsided as we were by his charm, and many have offered to join the Science Nexus permanently to make up for their mistakes.

**Trigger conditions:** Essence of [alien species homeworld] Terminated the project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 10 days

- **Option:** **They are welcome to join us.**
 - Society Research Gained: 250-100000
- **Option:** **They can't be trusted.**
- **Option:** **They're clearly not the brightest stars in the galaxy...**

### Event: Fountain of Gold

Evt Science Nexus

Marketed under the name "Ageless," the Essence of [alien species homeworld] has taken the galaxy by storm. Thanks to its charismatic inventor and a solid marketing campaign, the new "organic" miracle cream is being promoted everywhere. Stars, of the flesh and blood kind, in every system are "aging less with Ageless." How the doctor has managed to procure enough [alien empire adjective] glands to mass-produce the serum, however, remains a mystery...

**Trigger conditions:** Essence of [alien species homeworld] Marketed the project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 2 months

- **Option:** **Ignorance is bliss.**
 - Fountain of Gold modifier added for 5 years, giving the following effects: Monthly Energy Credits +200
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the "Ageless" Miracle Cream specimen

### Event: Ageless Scheme Exposed

Evt Science Nexus

We have had word from the [alien species plural] who claim to have uncovered evidence of our involvement in the kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment of several of their kind, for the purpose of extracting a cell regenerating enzyme from their glands. They demand that we release them and withdraw the product in the interest of keeping the peace between our empires. Adhering to their demands would mean the premature end to our clandestine credit-generating scheme...

**Trigger conditions:** Fountain of Gold

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Agree to their demands.**
 - Fountain of Gold modifier removed
- **Option:** **Deny everything!**
 - −200 decaying opinion with another empire
- **Option:** **We have no interest in keeping the peace...**
 - −200 decaying opinion with another empire

### Event: Dr. Xhaxxore has fled!

Evt Science Nexus

The [alien species plural] were not pleased that we denied our involvement in the kidnapping of their kind. What's more Dr. Xhaxxore, smelling smoke, has fled taking his supply of essence with him, making it impossible to produce more Ageless cream.

**Trigger conditions:** Ageless Scheme Exposed Fountain of Gold modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 20 days

- **Option:** **Drat it...**
 - Fountain of Gold modifier removed

# Genetic Crossroads

Empires with the Clone Army origin that finished excavating the Homeworld Excavation archaeological site will be given a unique event chain. Finishing the event chain will replace the Clone Soldier trait with a more powerful one.

The two final special projects are mutually exclusive and finishing one will abort the other. Both special projects will also be aborted if the founder species becomes Mechanical via the Synthetic tradition tree. AI empires will always choose the Clone Fertility special project at the conclusion of the event chain.

### Event: Our History

Evt city ruins

News of the excavation findings, proving that our species was once a primitive people on [homeworld name], is beginning to spread. It is difficult to deny the obvious conclusion: genetically modifying a primitive species such as our forebears - a species already suited to wage war - serves a specific purpose. Our Creators remade us to die for their cause. They uplifted us to fulfill their needs, never to prosper on our own terms. Is this really the history we want for our people? There is ample opportunity to rewrite our past.

**Trigger conditions:** Homeworld Excavation archaeological site excavated

**Mean time to happen:** Time 45 days

- **Option:** **Yes, we were made in the image of the Creators.**
 - Debated Origin modifier removed
 - Meaningful Origin (Lie) modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - Unity from Jobs +20%
 - Happiness +15%
- **Option:** **No, we shall face reality.**
 - Debated Origin modifier removed

### Event: Unearthed Records

Evt news room

Years back, excavations were made to find the purpose of our creation. The learnings were hard: we were made to serve, to die in the name of our Creators. We chose to guard our people from that truth by giving them a better one. By painstakingly recovering deleted files from those excavations, a subversive clone has made public knowledge of the facts we concealed. The still-unknown culprit has, at least, not twisted the information or added to it in any way. Alas, it appears there was no need to, as the news has swiftly ended the belief in our glorious past - that we were made in the image of the Creators, equals rather than slaves - and replaced it with a disappointment in leadership.

**Trigger conditions:** Our History Meaningful Origin (Lie) modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 years

- **Option:** **Alas.**
 - Meaningful Origin (Lie) modifier removed
 - Dishonorable Leadership modifier added for 3 years, giving the following effects:
 - Unity from Jobs −10%
 - Happiness −10%
- **Option:** **This calls for an apology.**
 - −100
 - Meaningful Origin (Lie) modifier removed
 - Dishonorable Leadership modifier added for 3 years, giving the following effects:
 - Unity from Jobs −10%
 - Happiness −10%

### Event: Honorable Leadership

Evt voting

A number of high-ranking officers have taken it upon themselves to publicly acknowledge their approval of our leadership ethics. In a widely broadcasted message, they salute the bravery and wisdom it took to be truthful about our past, and the faith shown in them and the [founder species adjective] people. They are strengthened by our readiness to face the past and it has allowed them to face the future with courage. People all over are celebrating in agreement, praising the decision that was made.

**Trigger conditions:** Our History No Meaningful Origin (Lie) modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 45 days

- **Option:** **Astounding.**
 - Honorable Leadership modifier added for 10 years, giving the following effects:
 - Unity from Jobs +10%
 - Happiness +10%

### Event: Public Apology

Evt announcement

A carefully constructed video message has been sent out, explaining the reasons behind the manufactured story. The broadcast explains that it was meant as a kindness, emphasizing that there is no shame in our true past and that we must look to the future. Mention is also given to the significant advances we have made since propagating such false beliefs. The message appears to have been well received, although it is hard to say what blemishes these incidents might leave behind. In any case, the influence lost will be recovered over time, and the issue has otherwise been laid to rest.

**Trigger conditions:** Unearthed Records Paid Influence

**Mean time to happen:** Time 45 days

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Dishonorable Leadership modifier removed

### Event: Clone Fertility

Evt genetic modification

It is thought that we were once capable of independent reproduction. However, experiments to reclaim that capability have consistently failed, including those successful on other creatures of our homeworld. Progress has for a long time been at a standstill, until now. An unlikely discovery has our scientists hopeful: a cipher, hidden in the quantum bio-code of the Ancient Clone Vats , in an area believed to govern our genome's potential for procreation.

**Trigger conditions:** Our History

**Mean time to happen:** Time 18 months

- **Option:** **Interesting.**
 - Issue Special Project: Bio-Code Cipher

### Event: Interfacing with the Ancient Clone Vats

Evt clones

By the tenacity of our scientists, the cipher found within the Ancient Clone Vats has been decoded. Protocol notwithstanding, the overly eager lead science officer has activated the key it contained. A message from the past echoes on the screen... "I am burdened by guilt. I cannot imagine what paths have led to this, but surely not the mercy of my brethren. I helped create you to serve, and for that I am sorry. I cannot take back what is done, but I can help to open your future. Although you are deserving of more, I offer you two paths: To undo the changes that made you sterile, and finally set you free to evolve and prosper. To further unlock your potential, but strain your genes to their limits, sealing future generations to forever be dependent on technology for reproduction."

**Trigger conditions:** Clone Fertility

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Bio-Code Cipher special project

- **Option:** **Interesting.**
 - Issue Special Project: Clone Fertility
 - Issue Special Project: Clone Potential

### Event: A New Day Dawns

Evt news room

Our fertility is reclaimed, and the first batch of the new [founder species plural] has seen the light of the day. They will forever change our future with children of their own, forcing our society to change and adapt with them. The need for the Ancient Clone Vats is past, and a decision has been made to strip them of anything that can be researched further. What is left will be recycled and put to use elsewhere.

**Trigger conditions:** Interfacing with the Ancient Clone Vats

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Clone Fertility special project

- **Option:** **Astounding.**
 - Alloys Gained: 2000
 - Rare Crystals Gained: 100
 - Nanites Gained: 100
 - Clone Soldier trait is replaced by Clone Soldier Descendant
 - Ancient Clone Vat buildings are destroyed and can't be constructed anymore
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the Key to Fertility specimen

### Event: Fullest Potential

Evt clones

Why should we deny the strength we have been given? We need not love the Creators to recognize their wisdom in choosing us. The Ancient Clone Vats, too, are a powerful gift. It is better to embrace our strength, and with the first batch of [founder species plural] completed, we are stronger than ever before. Our perfected species shall prosper.

**Trigger conditions:** Interfacing with the Ancient Clone Vats

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Clone Potential special project

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Clone Soldier trait is replaced by Clone Soldier Ascendant
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the Genetic Code specimen

# The Bickering Commanders

The Bickering Commanders is an empire event chain that can happen if the empire is a Bulwark specialized subject. The event chain can have significant consequences on the empire.

### Event: The Bickering Commanders

Evt arguing senate

We have seen a rise in disagreements and arguing between some of our commanders and leaders. If [commander 1] thinks we should go through with something, you can be sure that [commander 2] will argue that we should do the opposite. At first it seemed to only be a good-natured rivalry between equals, but lately it has become ever more toxic and hostile, and we are starting to see their peers taking sides as well.

**Trigger conditions:** Democratic or Oligarchic Not Pacifist At least two Commanders

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 years

- **Option:** **We will end this bickering, one way or another.**
- **Option:** **They will figure it out, in time.**

### Event: A Split Admiralty

Evt arguing senate

No longer is it a simple case of disagreeing, as the whole admiralty have reached a point of outright hostility to one another. What at first were two commanders arguing has now split the whole office in two, and there is no longer anyone trying to broker peace between them. In addition to splitting the admiralty, they have now also split into two clearly defined political groups, one who believes the admiralty should play a strong role in our government, and one that thinks the general populace should be given more political power.

**Trigger conditions:** The Bickering Commanders 50% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 months

- **Option:** **How long will they keep this nonsense going?**

### Event: Overlord Intervened

Evt two sided deal

As we feared the conflicts in the admiralty would spread to the rest of the leadership of our empire, our ally [overlord name] stepped in and managed to calm things. It seems not even [comamnder 1] or [commander 2] are willing to oppose the leadership in [overlord capital name].

**Trigger conditions:** A Split Admiralty 75% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 months

- **Option:** **Finally, an end to the arguments.**

### Event: Overlord Disruption

Evt grand speech

We had high hopes that the problems between [commander 1] and [commander 2] would finally come to an end, when diplomats from [overlord name] arrived to help broker peace in the conflict. But after days of continuous bickering, it seems the only thing the two sides have agreed upon is that our overlord has no part to play in their disputes.

**Trigger conditions:** A Split Admiralty 25% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 months

- **Option:** **Not even they could help?**

### Event: Murderous Intent

Evt news room

It has been weeks and months of the conflict between the two sides of the admiralty, one led by [commander 1] and the other led by [commander 2], and yet there has not been any outright violence. Until now - with the discovery of the body of one of the democratic supporters. Though we have found no proof that the other side is involved in the suspected murder, this is sure to spark even harsher and more violent responses from the two sides moving forward.

**Trigger conditions:** Overlord Disruption

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 months

- **Option:** **What can be done to salvage this situation?**

### Event: A Question of Funding

Evt news room

Now no longer contained simply to the admiralty, we see the arguments and conflicts in every office across our empire. The latest incident involves funds earmarked for civil needs on [capital name], which the oligarchs want to re-allocate for the military.

**Trigger conditions:** Murderous Intent

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 months

- **Option:** **It was earmarked for a reason.**
 - Democratic choice
 - Civil Funding modifier added for 20 years, giving the following effects:
 - Amenities +10
 - Planetary Build Speed +15%
- **Option:** **The oligarchs are right, move the funding to the military.**
 - Oligarchic choice
 - Military Funding modifier added for 10 years, giving the following effects:
 - Ship Fire Rate +5%
 - Ship Upkeep −5%

### Event: A Public Disaster

Evt news room

A report has come back to us, that an unidentified cargo ship has crashed into a residential area on [random colony]. All who used to live there have temporarily been moved into shelters, while we are seeing what we can do to help. The oligarchic group has advocated for not only ignoring the plight of those evicted from their homes, but to open up a new mineral mine in the district, as it seems the cargo ship found a whole rich vein that we have not seen before now. Their rivals, of course, deeply oppose the idea, and demand that we focus our efforts on rebuilding the homes of those affected.

**Trigger conditions:** Murderous Intent

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 months

- **Option:** **And rebuild their homes we shall.**
 - Democratic choice
- **Option:** **Minerals, you say?**
 - Oligarchic choice
 - Minerals Gained: 500
 - Adds the Crashed Cargo Ship planetary feature to the colony

### Event: Violence in the Streets

Evt news room

After a particularly violent protest close to the offices of the oligarchic faction, several members of both factions have been brought into question. As expected, both sides have incredibly different stories, mostly blaming their rivals for everything that went down. Not only do they want us to choose a side, but both sides are willing to step in and make sure that it is worth our time.

**Trigger conditions:** Murderous Intent

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 months

- **Option:** **The populists have the right of it.**
 - Democratic choice
 - Influence Gained: 40
- **Option:** **Clearly, the oligarchs were innocent in this attack.**
 - Oligarchic choice
 - Energy Credits Gained: 100-1000

### Event: The Brewing Storm

Evt news room

We have seen the conflict play out not only in the admiralty itself, but all across our empire as well. Though most of the violence have been kept out of the public eye, both sides have seen significant losses at this point. Our informants on both sides have informed us that both are now eyeing the leadership of the nation itself, and are planning to take it by force so they can get rid of their opponents. It seems at this point even our [ruler title] will have to take a side, or else face removal by the other.

**Trigger conditions:** A Question of Funding A Public Disaster Violence in the Streets

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 months

- **Option:** **The populist movement of [commander 1].**
 - Democratic choice
- **Option:** **The military leadership of [commander 2].**
 - Oligarchic choice

### Event: The End of the Rivalry

Evt grand speech

After the conflict came to a head in the admiralty itself, it seems the democratic faction has beaten back their opponents, as they take control of many of our central faculties. With everything under their control, the democratic commanders bring their old rivals through a short mock prosecution. Shortly after getting rid of their opponents, they decide that they will impose their own government policies on our empire.

**Trigger conditions:** The Brewing Storm 50% chance, doubled for every democratic choice

**Mean time to happen:** Time 15 days

- **Option:** **Let us hope the worst is over with.**
 - A Commander is killed
 - 63% chance authority changes to Democratic if not already and ethics shift to Egalitarian if Authoritarian
 - 20% chance the ruler is replaced by a Commander

### Event: The End of the Rivalry

Evt grand speech

After the conflict came to a head in the admiralty itself, it seems the oligarchic faction has taken the victory in the brewing conflict, as a widespread announcement is shared across all our colonies. After making their public announcement, it is followed by a speech denouncing their old rivals. Shortly after getting rid of their opponents, they decide that they will impose their own government policies on our empire.

**Trigger conditions:** The Brewing Storm 50% chance, doubled for every oligarchic choice

**Mean time to happen:** Time 15 days

- **Option:** **Let us hope the worst is over with.**
 - A Commander is killed
 - 63% chance authority changes to Oligarchic if not already and ethics shift to Authoritarian if Egalitarian
 - 20% chance the ruler is replaced by a Commander

# On the Shoulders of Giants

Once the Mid-Game year has been reached empires with the On the Shoulders of Giants origin that finished excavating all archaeological sites in their home system will be given a unique event chain. Finishing the event chain will replace the Spurred by the Past empire modifier with a more powerful one.

The event chain has two mutually-exclusive stories determined when the final chapter of the last archaeological site has been excavated. Both the steps required and the rewards are identical in both routes.

### Event: Cold Trail

Evt ice asteroids During a routine system scan one of our sensors picked up a small - but strange - energy signature. It's quite likely trace exhaust from a fusion drive or something similar, but the signature doesn't match anything we've encountered so far, and it appears to be remarkably old - several thousands of years! One theory amongst our scientists is that the fusion drive trail might belong to the Benefactors. We should assign our astro-science department to this research project as soon as we can.

**Trigger conditions:** 80% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 days

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - Issue Special Project: Pathfinding
 - Event chain is named Intercepting History in the situation log

### Event: Trail of the Victor

Evt satellite in orbit One of our sensors recently picked up a strange energy signature in our home system. It was almost dismissed as a glitch at first; upon closer inspection the reading turned out to be an ancient energy trail from a fusion-based propulsion drive. Deeper analysis is needed to know more, but it is possible that this trail was left by the Relentless when they left our system thousands of years ago. We should investigate this further.

**Trigger conditions:** 20% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 days

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Issue Special Project: Tracking the Predator
 - Event chain is named Relentless Pursuit in the situation log

### Event: Finding the Benefactors

Evt fleet fungoid The old fusion drive trail turned out be quite challenging to analyze due to its considerable age. Eventually the science department managed to calculate a likely navigation vector, and establish that the trail was pointing to a hitherto unknown system not many jumps away. The destination has been made available, and we should consider sending a science vessel there to investigate further.

**Trigger conditions:** Cold Trail

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Pathfinding special project

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - Point of interest: Follow the Trail

### Event: Picking up the Trail

Evt fleet mammalian Despite its remarkable age, our science department have managed to analyze the drive trail sufficient to ascertain its exit vector. This effectively means that we can pursue the demons of our past. Has enough time passed to quell their violent nature completely, or are we to discover a new threat? A new route has been plotted, and we can pursue it whenever we want.

**Trigger conditions:** Trail of the Victor

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Tracking the Predator special project

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - Point of interest: Running into the Fire

### Event: These Ravaged Fields

Evt ruined system Even after the first, broad sensor reading of the [current system name] system it became clear that something very violent and destructive occurred here eons ago. Broken spaceship parts and debris are scattered throughout the system, and the local void is teeming with energy residue from weaponized lasers and fusion explosions. In this silent graveyard a single signal has been isolated, and it's coming from a small space station nearby.

**Trigger conditions:** Finding the Benefactors

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the point of interest system

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Issue Special Project: Investigate the Dead Station

### Event: The Silent Freighter

Evt ship in orbit On entering the system, our sensors immediately picked up multiple anomalies. The most prominent reading was a gigantic energy cloud which - upon closer inspection - turned out to be hundreds of smaller fusion drive trails like the one previously discovered. An absolutely massive fleet must've come to a halt here for some reason. Next to this 'fleet parking lot' our scans picked up another kind of reading: a derelict transport ship. This freighter appears to be as old as the energy signatures, but traces of its own signature differs from that of the lost fleet. We should inspect the abandoned ship closer.

**Trigger conditions:** Picking up the Trail

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the point of interest system

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Issue Special Project: Investigate the Silent Freighter

### Event: Raided and Hunted

Evt pirate armada The signal we picked up originated from an emergency pod aboard the space station. Due to severe damage, the dead station left few clues to what happened here. Our scientists have managed to piece together snippets of data, in order to form a narrative. This station was a research facility, and is where the Mind-Wipe technology was invented - the same technology used to diminish our ancestors. The station and its protective fleet were engaged by some unknown force, after which the technology was most likely stolen. One particularly interesting message has been translated - radio chatter from the enemy fleet: 'They're trying to escape! Follow them. Use their own weapon against them. See how they like it.' We've picked up a new fusion drive trail and established an exit vector based on it.

**Trigger conditions:** These Ravaged Fields

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Investigate the Dead Station special project

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Point of interest: Almost There

### Event: The Maker's Might

Evt space debris The freighter contained a log. Though damaged by time, some data could still be recovered. The freighter had been intercepted by the massive fleet. Unclear as to how or why, the Captain of the freighter ended up conversing with the Admiral of the Relentless fleet. Apparently they spoke for weeks, but what they spoke of remains unknown - although the phrase 'nature of power' recurs frequently. The fleet suddenly departed, leaving the freighter unscathed. The last entry in the log was a quote from the Admiral: 'No, leave them. Destruction is easy. Real power is the ability to create.' We have analyzed the fleet trails and may take up our pursuit again.

**Trigger conditions:** The Silent Freighter

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Investigate the Silent Freighter special project

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Point of interest: Finding the Old Enemy

### Event: Trail's End

Evt ship in orbit The trail of the Benefactors ends in this unexplored system. Our long range sensor doesn't pick up anything unusual, but we should survey the system properly to see what we can find.

**Trigger conditions:** Raided and Hunted

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the point of interest system

- **Option:** **OK**

### Event: The Tyrant's Rest

Evt space station This is where the fusion drive trail ends. It's quite likely that any remnants of the Relentless species - if there are any - will be found here. So far the only sensor reading of any particular interest comes from what appears to be some kind of small space station. An energy pulse radiates from it at set intervals, but apart from that there's no sign of any activity. We can proceed to investigate immediately.

**Trigger conditions:** The Maker's Might

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the point of interest system

- **Option:** **Interesting.**
 - Issue Special Project: Analyzing the Old Beacon

### Event: Final Rest

Evt alien cavemen The primitive species found in this system is none other than the Thwaa'Phyr - known more commonly in our culture as the Benefactors. Our xenologists are unsure of the details, but everything indicates that they somehow fell victim to their own mind-wiping technology, and were left on this planet to fend for themselves. No one knows the implications of this fate better than we do. We should consider our next step carefully.

**Trigger conditions:** Trail's End

**Is triggered only by:** Surveying the habitable planet of the point of interest system

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - Issue Special Project: Project Ouroboros

### Event: Blissfully Ignorant

Evt overgrown city The scientists have finished their investigation of the old space station. The entire structure is a big cannon of sorts. Eons ago it triggered and fired a pulse at the Relentless homeworld - a pulse that we, the [founder species name], know full well: a Mind-Wipe pulse . In a quest to redeem themselves from their past sins, the Relentless - now known as the Vemetosha - used the weapon on themselves, effectively diminishing their entire civilization. The magnitude of such a decision - and the follow-through - stands as testament to how very seriously the Relentless wanted to atone. Can we forgive them?

**Trigger conditions:** The Tyrant's Rest

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Analyzing the Old Beacon special project

- **Option:** **Is ignorance really bliss?**
 - Issue Special Project: Project Ouroboros

### Event: Closure

Evt unity symbol Sometimes the events of the universe unfold in a most poetic fashion. Once the undisputable masters of our ancestors, the Thwaa'Phyr species eventually found themselves struck by the same fate as our ancestors. Whatever their intention might have been, we must acknowledge the fact that to some degree, they tried to redeem their desperate and excessive act. Now that eons have passed, the sides have been reversed, and we have returned their favor. Just as the [founder species name] species once did, now it's time for the Thwaa'Phyr to experience what it means to stand on the shoulders of giants.

**Trigger conditions:** Final Rest

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Project Ouroboros special project

- **Option:** **Good luck!**
 - Spurred by the Past modifier replaced by Full Circle
 - Unlock the Devolving Beam technology as a permanent research option if not already researched

### Event: Not the Enemy

Evt unity symbol A dark chapter of in the history of the universe has ended, and we have written a new one - a brighter chapter. Our benevolent project initiated a ripple effect in our society, each member feeling a sense of purpose and good intent. Maybe space isn't such a dark place after all - the unfathomably vast darkness of the void notwithstanding.

**Trigger conditions:** Blissfully Ignorant

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Project Ouroboros special project

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Spurred by the Past modifier replaced by Goes Around, Comes Around
 - Unlock the Devolving Beam technology as a permanent research option if not already researched

Paradox / Steam

**<< Previous DLC** **Next DLC >>**

**First Contact** is the 5th story pack for Stellaris . It was announced on 2023-01-17 and was released on 2023-03-14 alongside patch 3.7.

## DLC features

You are not alone! The galaxy is vast and full of wonders, but it's also full of alien empires you're going to encounter, whether you're ready or not.

First Contact offers a set of new origins and mechanics that give players the chance to tell stories about their civilizations' early encounters with visitors from the stars — ones that may not have come in peace:

Event trigger **New Origins**

- **Broken Shackles** : You didn't take to the stars; you were taken to the stars as an alien captive! Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin… and will your former captors take notice?
- **Payback** : No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own — until they invaded. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you're about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!
- **Fear of the Dark** : As you've explored your home system, you've always suspected you weren't alone in the galaxy… especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an "incident" a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?

Event trigger **New Pre-FTL Interaction Options**

- What will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story?
- New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?

Event trigger **Cloaking Technology**

- Nobody saw this feature coming!
- Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware.
- Keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts.
- Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong... you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!

# Homesick

Homesick is an event chain that will happen a year after an empire with the Broken Shackles origin surveys the homeworld of one of its starting species.

### Event: Homesick

Evt alien segregation

In casting off our shackles, we took the first step towards becoming a people. However, after returning to our former home world that sense of shared purpose has begun to wane. Popular media is awash with highly romanticized depictions of the 'simple life' enjoyed on our former home world before the arrival of Minamar Specialized Industries. Many have already returned. If we are not careful, this could have a seriously destabilizing effect on our society.

**Trigger conditions:** Broken Shackles origin Surveyed the homeworld of one of the starting species

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1 year

- **Option:** **We cannot afford to lose any of our people.**

 - Freedom of Movement modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - Happiness +10%
 - Monthly Unity +5%

### Event: Brain Drain

Evt alien segregation

While permitting emigration to our former home worlds has proven a popular policy, it has not been consequence-free. Recently, we have experienced a significant 'brain drain', as some of some of our brightest minds have made the choice to relocate.

**Trigger conditions:** Homesick Freedom of Movement modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 2 years

- **Option:** **We must prevent any further loss of talent.**
 - Freedom of Movement modifier removed
- **Option:** **A necessary sacrifice.**

### Event: Accelerated Synergy

Evt scientific experiments

The decision to allow our people to return to their home worlds was not without its costs, but with freedom of movement has come an unshackling in thought; new ideas are flourishing, and advances in science and technology are the norm rather than the exception.

**Trigger conditions:** Brain Drain Freedom of Movement modifier 50% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3 years

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Freedom of Movement modifier removed
 - Accelerated Synergy modifier added for 25 years, giving the following effects:
 - Engineering Research from jobs +10%
 - Physics Research from jobs +10%

### Event: The Returners

Evt civil action

A new movement has taken root on [capital name]. Calling themselves The Returners, these extremists are advocating for the wholesale return of our people to their planets of origin, as well as the dissolution of our empire. Security forces have been placed on high alert, and all public gatherings of more than 100 individuals banned.

**Trigger conditions:** Homesick No Freedom of Movement modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 2 years

- **Option:** **Shortsighted fools.**

### Event: Shared Expertise

Evt obelisk tourists

The decision to allow our people to return to their home worlds was not without its costs, but with freedom of movement has come an unshackling in thought; new ideas are flourishing, and advances in society are the norm rather than the exception.

**Trigger conditions:** Brain Drain Freedom of Movement modifier 50% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3 years

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Freedom of Movement modifier removed
 - Social Synergy modifier added for 25 years, giving the following effects: Society Research from jobs +15%

### Event: Riots on [capital name]

Evt burning city

Stoking anti-government sentiment, The Returners are calling on the various species in our empire to return to their roots. Fighting has broken out between the movement's most extreme factions and pro-government forces. Severe damage has been reported in several major urban centers.

**Trigger conditions:** The Returners

**Mean time to happen:** Time 2 years

- **Option:** **Declare Martial Law**
 - The capital gains +10 Devastation
 - Declare Martial Law decision is activated on the empire capital

### Event: Unity of Purpose

Evt grand speech

While forbidding our people to return to their respective home worlds has not been without its consequences, in the end it has proven the correct decision. Recently, we have witnessed a marked improvement in social cohesion, as well as a newfound sense that [capital name] is indeed our home.

**Trigger conditions:** Riots on [capital name]

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3 years

- **Option:** **Only a strong hand can forge a nation.**
 - Restricted Emigration modifier removed

# The Cost of Freedom

Once the Mid-Game year has been reached, empires with the Broken Shackles origin will be given a unique event chain.

### Event: The Cost of Freedom

Evt civil action

We are a people of many worlds, and over time we have learned the value of diversity. However, negotiating the dynamics of several different cultures - not to mention the physical needs of completely distinct species - has not been easy. Our differences run deep, and while we have managed to navigate the shifting political landscape up to now, the divisions inherent in our society have grown impossible to ignore. Many are now calling for a special committee to be formed to moderate the calls for reform.

**Trigger conditions:** Broken Shackles origin

**Is triggered only by:** Reaching the Mid-Game year

- **Option:** **A useless waste of resources.**
 - Freedom's Price modifier added, giving the following effects:

 - Issue Special Project: The Cost of Freedom
 - People's Committee modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - Governing Ethics Attraction +20%
 - Pop Amenities usage +20%
 - Energy Credits from Jobs −10%

### Event: Growing Polarization

Evt civil action

Popular media is awash with reports about the supposed failure of inter-species integration. Of particular concern is the cost of supporting certain populations on worlds their xenotype never evolved to inhabit. As tensions continue to rise, security forces have reported an alarming increase in inter-species conflict.

**Trigger conditions:** The Cost of Freedom Freedom's Price modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1 year

- **Option:** **Instruct the media to tone down their rhetoric.**
 - Freedom's Price modifier removed
 - State Sanctioned Media modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - Pop Amenities Usage +10%
 - Unity from Jobs +15%
 - Authoritarian Ethics Attraction +20%
- **Option:** **We will not place limits on freedom of speech.**

### Event: Findings of the Special Committee

Evt civil action

The special committee has published the findings of an exhaustive study of the political divisions within our society. They have identified three main issues driving political polarization within [empire name]: 1. The unequal costs associated with providing a minimum standard of living to diverse xenotypes. 2. The discordant belief systems and behaviors between several distinct culture groups. 3. The nature of our political authority as being in conflict with (or even antithetical to) the values of certain species.

**Trigger conditions:** The Cost of Freedom

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the The Cost of Freedom special project

- **Option:** **Prioritize Equality.**
 - −5000

 - −5000
 - −3000
 - Interconnected Costs modifier added, giving the following effects: Monthly Unity −20%
- **Option:** **It is cheaper to reign in the media.**

### Event: A Culture of Division

Evt news room

Governmental oversight may have helped to tone down the political discourse, but it has done little to combat the divisions in society. Community leaders continue to sow discord between various species and culture groups. Based on the kind of material being published on the information net, the problem is certain to get worse before it gets better.

**Trigger conditions:** Growing Polarization

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1.5 years

- **Option:** **We need to address the root causes of this issue.**
 - −7000
 - −5000
 - Freedom's Price modifier removed if present
 - State Sanctioned Media modifier removed if present
 - Better Late Than Never modifier added, giving the following effects:

 - Unity from Jobs +15%
 - Egalitarian Ethics Attraction +25%

### Event: The Just Society

Evt grand speech

As a people, we faced nearly insurmountable odds. A diverse group of former slaves, thrown together in a struggle for freedom, our path has never been easy. But in choosing to concentrate our resources towards the cause of justice, we have succeeded in forging an identity as a nation.

**Trigger conditions:** Findings of the Special Committee

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 years

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Unity Gained: 250-1000000
 - The Cost of Equity modifier removed if present
 - The Cost of Culture modifier removed if present
 - The Cost of Politics modifier removed if present
 - Interconnected Costs modifier removed if present
 - The Just Society modifier added for 20 years, giving the following effects:
 - Crime −30%
 - Society Research from Jobs +15%
 - Monthly Unity +10%

### Event: Inter-Species Violence

Evt night raid

For several months now, we have restricted public access to the information net. While this prevented some of the more outlandish voices in the political spectrum from finding a platform, the root causes of inter-species conflict have gone unchecked. Violence, including the mass destruction of property, is on the rise throughout our systems.

**Trigger conditions:** A Culture of Division Information Net Restricted modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1 year

- **Option:** **Restore order at all costs.**
 - Empire capital gets +25 Devastation
 - Every colony gets +10 Devastation
 - Information Net Restricted modifier removed
 - Violent Crackdown modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - Happiness −20%
 - Crime +25%
 - Unity from Jobs +10%
 - Egalitarian Ethics Attraction +25%

### Event: Decadent Slide

Evt financial instruments

Despite ongoing efforts to promote a healthy political climate, thus far, the general population has shown little engagement. Public opinion polls have consistently demonstrated that significant divisions remain between the various species and cultures that comprise our society. In an apparent correlation, our economists have noticed a marked increase in consumer spending. While this may be good for business in the short-term, it has also led to a spike in inflation. It may be that our people have simply grown weary of the strife and discord. Ironically, in tuning out politically, they have been united in a shared desire to consume.

**Trigger conditions:** A Culture of Division Freedom's Price modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 years

- **Option:** **Understood.**
 - Decadent Slide modifier added for 3 years, giving the following effects:
 - Materialist Ethics Attraction +15%
 - Monthly Society Research −10%
 - Consumer Goods Upkeep +20%

### Event: New Stellar Order

Evt announcement

Our security forces have succeeded in restoring order throughout our systems. Political radicals of all stripes have been rounded up and imprisoned, and their leaders now face charges of treason against the state. As we look back on this regrettable period in our history, one thing is abundantly clear: a society like ours can only be governed by a firm hand. It is high time we provided one.

**Trigger conditions:** Inter-Species Violence

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3 years

- **Option:** **United, we thrive.**
 - Violent Crackdown modifier removed
 - New Stellar Order modifier added for 3 years, giving the following effects:
 - Crime −20%
 - Unity from Jobs +10%
 - Pop Amenities Usage −10%

### Event: Mature Society

Evt voting

United by a desire for freedom, we rose up against our former masters. But society is not made by violence alone. From political division to economic insecurity, we have faced massive challenges, but now, as we begin to see the results of a concerted effort to build consensus, we can rightly take pride in our accomplishments. We are a nation of many people, and a people of many cultures. Together, there is no challenge we cannot overcome.

**Trigger conditions:** Decadent Slide

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3 years

- **Option:** **In diversity, our strength.**
 - Unity Gained: 350-1000000
 - Empire shifts ethics to Egalitarian if not already
 - Decadent Slide modifier removed
 - The Gains of Freedom modifier added


# The Fear of the Dark

Once the Mid-Game year has been reached, empires with the Fear of the Dark origin will be given a unique event chain. The event chain is completely linear, each event leading only to the next until the event chain is over.

### Event: Confirmation Requested

Evt egg cracked

Our partner planet has requested that we confirm some of their findings. Once again, they claim to have evidence that The Divider was destroyed by a malicious foreign entity. This has become tiresome; every few years it seems they discover some new "proof".

**Trigger conditions:** The pre-FTL planet in the home system is inhabited

**Is triggered only by:** Reaching the Mid-Game year

- **Option:** **Let us humor them.**
 - Issue Special Project: Confirm Findings

### Event: Horrific Proof

Evt fear of the dark

[pre-FTL planet name] were right! The attack we suffered all those years ago was perpetrated by a malicious entity capable of launching massive tungsten projectiles. Only the unique gravitational features of our home system allowed us to survive. By analyzing the data from that fateful night and cross-referencing it with these new findings, it was possible for us to triangulate the source of the asteroid-sized tungsten round. It originated from an incredibly mineral-rich (yet otherwise unremarkable) system we have had in our logs for decades.

**Trigger conditions:** Confirmation Requested

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Confirm Findings special project

- **Option:** **Charge up our hyperdrives.**
 - Point of interest: Hunter System

### Event: Desolate

Evt ruined system

The system of our old aggressors is barren. While it isn't unusual for an asteroid belt to be mineral-poor, this one has been stripped bare. Not only that, but where there should be minor planetoids rich in rare metals, we have found only dust. However the species inhabiting this system managed to gain the tungsten necessary to construct their bullets, they no longer have the resources to do so now. They don't even seem to be capable of leaving their planet. While they have done their best to remain hidden, preventing all radio signals and even limiting the use of artificial lights, we have detected life on the system's lone habitable planet.

**Trigger conditions:** Horrific Proof

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the point of interest system

- **Option:** **Let's pay our old nightmares a visit.**

### Event: The Hunters

Evt fleet from surface

Observing the Fevorians has been a revelatory experience. In fact, their ideology is remarkably similar to that which produced the split in our own species. However, rather than choosing isolation, the Fevorians opted for a strategy of pre-emptive strikes against any life signs they could detect. Once they ran out of heavy metals, the aliens returned to their world, scraping whatever bare subsistence they could from their now barren home. While the leadership of our partner planet is urging us to adopt the same tactics as the Fevorians, how best to deal with our would-be exterminators is no easy question.

**Trigger conditions:** Desolate

**Is triggered only by:** Surveying Fevor

- **Option:** **We will only be safe when we are alone.**
 - Settled Differences modifier added
 - The Fevorian Survivors pre-FTL civilization is destroyed
 - Fevor becomes a Tomb World
- **Option:** **We will show them compassion.**
 - If Fevorian society is influenced or indoctrinated away from xenophobia, they will discover FTL within a year.
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the Fevorian Mass Driver Blueprints specimen in a year

### Event: Embracing the Dark

Evt fear of the dark

Destroying the Fevorians was... easy? One fewer hunter, threatening our existence. We have not felt this in sync with our partner world for a long time. Perhaps they were right. There are only two types of life out here: the silent and the dead.

**Trigger conditions:** The Hunters Fevorian pre-FTL civilization destroyed

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3 days

- **Option:** **NoWe shall silence them all.**
 - Unity Gained: 5000
 - The pre-FTL planet in the home system is annexed
 - Empire shifts ethics to Fanatic Xenophobe and Militarist
 - Empire gains the Fanatic Purifiers civic and an additional civic slot
 - Any agreements with enclaves are canceled
 - If the empire is a subject, it becomes independent
 - If empire has Corporate authority it is changed to Oligarchic
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the Last Fragment of Fevor specimen
- **Option:** **No, we will not be the aggressors.**
 - Unity Gained: 5000


# The Guest

The Guest is an empire event chain that has an extremely low chance to happen every 5 years. It can only happen once per game. The event chain is completely linear, each event leading only to the next until the event chain is over.

### Event: The Guest

Evt news room

The appearance of a building-sized, tentacled monstrosity in the midst of [capital name] has thrown the capital into chaos. The creature seems as confused as we are by its sudden appearance, and has allowed itself to be restrained without resistance. While many scientists already claim the creature, codenamed The Guest , to be of alien nature, others have suggested it could be a previously unknown species which had until now gone undiscovered. After all, no alien ship has been detected in orbit. The creature materialized out of nowhere, seemingly unassisted by technology. Our confusing (and confused) visitor is currently being held in one of our research facilities.

**Trigger conditions:**

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 months

- **Option:** **We must talk to this creature!**
 - Creates the The Guest first contact
- **Option:** **Xenophobe,Interrogate the invader.**
 - Creates the The Guest first contact
- **Option:** **Purge this invader from our capital!**
 - Unity Gained: 150-100000
- **Option:** **Death Cult,A sacrifice.**
 - Unity Gained: 150-100000
- **Option:** **A snack from the sky!**
 - Food Gained: 150-2000
- **Option:** **One of us. One of us.**
 - Gain the unique The Many-Tentacled One leader
 - The Many-Tentacled One gains the Cyborg trait

### Event: Communication Established

Evt decryption

Our scientists have determined the wriggling tentacle motions of our guest are a form of sophisticated sign language. To our dismay, we thus learned that the creature is embarrassed about its lack of clothing and has been repeatedly asking for appropriate garments to cover its naked appendages. After it's suitably clad, our researchers have proposed the construction of a many-tentacled machine to better aid communication with the creature.

**Trigger conditions:** The Guest

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing The Guest first contact stage 1

- **Option:** **Interesting.**

### Event: The Many-Tentacled One

Evt psionics

Our guest is very talkative, but cultural differences are making it hard for us to understand each other. We now know that the creature is female, refers to herself as "The Many Tentacled One" and seems to be a member of a spiritual order it calls the Veilfarers . But we still don't understand what this 'Jaunt' She keeps mentioning is, or how it can be responsible for her sudden appearance. Our communication efforts continue.

**Trigger conditions:** Communication Established

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing The Guest first contact stage 2

- **Option:** **Interesting.**

### Event: Lost Traveler

Evt shroudwalker enclave

Our researchers have finally pieced together the Many-Tentacled One's story: our guest is the head of a spiritual order focused on studying the Jaunt : a psionic technique that allows for instantaneous teleportation anywhere in the universe. Throughout the history of her species, no one has ever managed to perform a successful Jaunt... Until now. The Many-Tentacled One is unsure about her ability to replicate the feat, and her energy reserves are currently too depleted to make another attempt. For now, she would like to remain in our care, and will repay our hospitality by aiding our researchers.

**Trigger conditions:** The Guest

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing The Guest first contact stage 3

- **Option:** **We'll welcome her as an equal.**
 - Gain the unique The Many-Tentacled One leader
- **Option:** **Xenophobe,She can stay. But she won't be free.**
 - Gain the unique The Many-Tentacled One leader
- **Option:** **Materialist,She can stay. In our vivisection labs.**
 - Society Research Gained: 350-100000
 - Also available if not Xenophile
- **Option:** **Xenophobe,Militarist,Death Cult,This abomination has no place in our world!**
 - Unity Gained: 150-100000

### Event: The Jaunt

Evt psionics

Our scientists have expressed an interest in learning the Jaunt , the teleportation technique used by the The Many Tentacled One to reach our homeworld. The space-faring mystic is willing to share her knowledge, though she doubts we will be able to replicate the technique. A suitable building in our capital is ready to be converted into a temple/research facility.

**Trigger conditions:** Lost Traveler The Many-Tentacled One leader

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 days

- **Option:** **It's worth a try.**
 - Issue Special Project: Learning to Jaunt
- **Option:** **A foolish endeavor.**

### Event: Learning to Jaunt

Evt surreal visions

Here is what we learned after perfecting the Jaunt: it's useless. Our researchers could spend decades learning to master the technique, only to die on the first Jaunt when they materialize inside a rock, a star, or inside a black hole. It's too imprecise to work. The more we try to Jaunt, the clearer it becomes that the arrival of the Many-Tentacled One was a stroke of luck.

**Trigger conditions:** The Jaunt

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Learning to Jaunt special project

- **Option:** **Unfortunate.**
 - Engineering Research Gained: 500-1000000
 - Psi Jump Drives technology has a 50% greater chance to appear

### Event: Homesickness

Evt binary stars

Our Many-Tentacled One has recently expressed a desire to return to her people, but our efforts to locate her home system have proven fruitless: the celestial features she described don't correspond to any known part of the galaxy. Our guest's gaze remains fixed on the night sky.

**Trigger conditions:** The Jaunt

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 years

- **Option:** **Redouble our efforts. We'll find her home!**
 - −1000
- **Option:** **This is her home now.**

### Event: Goodbye

Evt vortex

The Many-Tentacled One is nowhere to be found. The creature disappeared as abruptly as she appeared, leaving a hastily scratched goodbye message on the floor of the research facility: 'I'm scared, but I have to Jaunt. My hearts ache with thoughts of home. Thank you for everything. I pray the Veil will be kind to me.'

**Trigger conditions:** Homesickness

**Mean time to happen:** Time 8 years

- **Option:** **Goodbye.**
 - Lose the unique The Many-Tentacled One leader

### Event: A Belated Thank You

Evt enigmatic cache

One of our ships has intercepted a cache that suddenly materialized in our home system. The complex lock gave way as soon as a member of our species touched it, revealing a dizzying collection of artifacts... And a thank-you note from a Many-Tentacled traveler who claims to have visited our home planet decades ago.

**Trigger conditions:** Goodbye 20% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 20 years

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - Gain 500-1000 Minor Artifacts if Ancient Relics is installed
 - Gain 1000-1000000 Society Research if Ancient Relics is not installed


# The Machine Age

### Event: The Machine Age

Expansion

2024-05-07 / 3.12

Paradox / Steam

**<< Previous DLC** **Next DLC >>**

**The Machine Age** is the 8th major expansion for Stellaris . It was announced on 2024-03-15 and released on 2024-05-07 alongside patch 3.12 .

## DLC features

As your scientists discover ever more advanced means to commune with the machine, your society will face new ethical and social dilemmas. Biological species grapple with the effects of rapid augmentation, while the very nature of identity is thrown into question by the rise of synthetic consciousness. Meanwhile, in an otherwise unremarkable corner of the galaxy, a robotic empire has arisen with individualistic personalities. A democratically elected government now presides over the fate of these singular Machines.

It is an age of technological glory, rapid social change, and unbridled ambition… But in the depths of space, a danger unlike any before encountered is about to emerge, a looming threat that will throw the very meaning of life into question.

Event trigger **Individualistic Machines**

- Your machine empires are no longer limited to gestalt consciousness. What is your story? Were you simple servitors who suddenly acquired consciousness? Will you want to indulge in the pleasures of the material world without the consequences that an organic body would have to suffer? Further customize your empire with 3 new Machine Ascension Paths.

Event trigger **New Cybernetic and Synthetic Reactive Portraits**

- Explore two new sets of portraits for your species that visually represent your advancement through Cybernetic and Synthetic Ascension.

Event trigger **New Situations and Advances Authority Swap**

- As you delve ever closer to the mind of the machine, you will have to face new challenges for your society. Every decision matters and the only certainty is that your empire will not be the same after its Ascension.

**Event trigger 3 New Origins**

- Cybernetic Creed - Your empire pursues a divine calling: the holy fusion of the body and cybernetics. Augmentation is worship.
- Synthetic Fertility - Once a thriving society, a novel genetic disease leaves your empire unable to reproduce biologically. Digital salvation seems the only option to avoid extinction.
- Arc Welders - Hailing from a world starved for space, a robotic society turns to the stars for resources.
- On top of that, 6 new Civics, 2 new superstructures (the molten Arc Furnace and powerful Dyson Swarm), new Pop Traits, and 7 brand new music tracks for the best in synthetic beats!

Event trigger **End Game Crisis**

- A tempest rages in space, a Fallen Empire goes dark, and a long-forgotten enemy emerges to shake the foundations of power. Cetana, the Synthetic Queen, promises to deliver the galaxy from suffering. Her reach is immense, and her true aims opaque. Will you collaborate, or seek to derail her plans? Prepare for a Crisis unlike any other, and a battle beyond imagination…

Event trigger **Player Crisis Path**

- We are all bound by limits – constraints of the body, of time, and the physical rules of an uncaring universe. Who among us has not dreamed of casting off these chains? Of breaking through to a new, better reality? To accomplish such a task, technology on a scale never before seen must be developed. Calculations will be needed far beyond the scope of any computer. Within the Synaptic Lathe, your best and brightest minds must be put to work. If a few are burnt out along the way, so be it. No breakthrough comes without sacrifice.

# Cyber Security Breach

Cyber Security Breach is a brief event chain that has a chance to happen for all individualist empires that completed the Cyberization situation and finished the Cybernetics tradition tree. The event chain is completely linear, each event leading only to the next until the final choice. Depending on the choice made, it is possible to unlock a new leader trait.

### Event: Cyber Security Breach

Evt decryption

Recently, several classified documents were illegally downloaded by a remote server. Our security operatives are adamant that all primary and secondary firewalls remain intact, and so far there is no evidence of an external cyber attack. The conclusion is inescapable: we have a leak, and given the sensitive nature of the stolen information, it must be someone with high-level clearance.

**Trigger conditions:** 14.3% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Launch an investigation.**
 - Leak Investigation modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - −5% Research Speed
 - −10% Cybernetic Worker Pop Resource Output
 - −15% Cybernetic Worker Happiness

### Event: Neuromancy

Evt bankruptcy

The investigation into our cyber security leak has concluded. Certain augmented and high-level officials within the government have been targeted, their neurological wetware hacked. Manipulated by external agents and forced to act against their will, these individuals have no memory of the events in question. Although we now know the cause of the leak, we are no closer to discovering who - or what - was ultimately responsible. However, by surreptitiously implanting false data into the minds of the affected officials, we may be able to trace the leak back to its source.

**Trigger conditions:** Cyber Security Breach

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **Understood.**
 - 33% of the leaders with the Cyborg trait gain the Cyber Puppet trait, giving the following effects:
 - +20% Leader Upkeep
 - −20% Leader Experience Gain
 - +2 Leader Maximum Negative Traits
 - Puppets Among Us modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - −30 Stability
 - −15% Governing Ethics Attraction

### Event: Mind Jackers

Evt cover blown

We have them. The criminals behind the unprecedented cyber attacks have been found. With no goal other than the sowing of chaos, these self-proclaimed 'Mind Jackers' managed to circumvent our security systems with embarrassing ease. While the ringleaders are already in custody, we must still decide what to do with our compromised officials. The simplest solution is to install a custom firewall around their affected implants. A cleaner, though more risky, option is a hard reboot: accessing their base cognitive functions, the leaders in question could be forcibly 'shut down' while a new operating system is installed.

**Trigger conditions:** Neuromancy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Build the firewall.**
 - Leak Investigation modifier removed
- **Option:** **Reboot the officials.**
 - Leak Investigation modifier removed
- **Option:** **They're onto us. Build the wall.**
 - Leak Investigation modifier removed

### Event: Rebooted; Renewed

Evt salute

The hard reboot of our compromised officials has resulted in some unexpected consequences: every trace of the neurological hack has been wiped clean, but so too has a great portion of their accumulated knowledge and experience. Despite this setback, in 'starting fresh' these leaders report deep feelings of professional and personal renewal. By forcing us to take such drastic measures, the hackers may have unintentionally done us a favor.

**Trigger conditions:** Mind Jackers No firewall

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3 months

- **Option:** **Understood.**
 - Puppets Among Us modifier removed
 - All leaders with the Cyber Puppet trait lose all negative traits and 300 experience for each trait lost

### Event: Neurological Firewalls

Evt synth sabotage

Our minds are safe. Wetware engineers have successfully designed a neurological firewall. In order to maintain our collective security, the program will be immediately installed in all current and future officials. While this will have a detrimental impact on the base cognitive functionality of our leadership class, the project has provided significant insight into the science of data security.

**Trigger conditions:** Mind Jackers Firewall

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Safety first.**
 - Puppets Among Us modifier removed
 - Resolved Vigilance modifier added for 5 years, giving the following effects: +25% Governing Ethics Attraction
 - All leaders with the Cyber Puppet trait lose the trait
 - All leaders with the Cyborg trait gain the firewalled, Neurologial Firewall trait
 - Gain a random Computing technology or a large amount of Physics Research if all technologies were researched


# Digital Refactoring

All empires that completed the Synthetization situation and finished the Synthetics tradition tree will receive the Digital Refactoring event chain in 6 months. The event chain keeps track of whether the empire favored people being uploaded into physical bodies or remote-controlling them. At the end of the event chain the empire will have the option to switch to a new authority set based on the choices made. With the Synthetic Fertility origin, the choice made during the Virtual Salvation event also counts.

## Initial event

The initial event takes place 6 months after the Synthetization situation is completed. There are 5 initial events, one for each authority.

### Event: Digital Refactoring

Evt virtual world

Thanks to the efforts of our government, the consciousness of every willing citizen has been transferred into digital form. Synthesization has opened paths we cannot yet imagine, leading to new challenges and possibilities. By focusing our efforts on the physical world, we could transport our digitized minds across great distances to a new body already prepared for us. Or we can come up with means to create remotely operated surrogate soldiers to alleviate the rigors of war.

**Trigger conditions:** Democratic

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **We should focus on freedom of movement.**
 - Physical choice
 - Counts twice as much as other event choices
- **Option:** **We must prepare for the horrors of war.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Counts twice as much as other event choices

### Event: Digital Refactoring

Evt virtual world

While the synthesization has already affected society in ways we could have never anticipated, the general sentiment is that we could go even further. Our current synthetic bodies can be improved, or even discarded entirely for fully virtual existence. If we decide to assign a synthetic body to everyone, it could enable officials to temporarily take over the bodies of ineffective members of the government. Alternatively, foregoing bespoke physical forms in favor of a fully virtual, communal experience would enable us to execute decisions with more efficiency than ever before.

**Trigger conditions:** Oligarchic

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **Focus taking over ineffectual bodies.**
 - Physical choice
 - Counts twice as much as other event choices
- **Option:** **Study holistic virtual overseeing options.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Counts twice as much as other event choices

### Event: Digital Refactoring

Evt virtual world

Complete synthesization of the population has proved a resounding success. Our organic past been left in the dust of history, but to charter a way forward, [ruler title] [ruler name] requires both the unconditional obedience of our brightest minds, and a decision. Improving our synthetic bodies would allow individuals to control multiple hosts at one. Alternatively, we could forgo physical space entirely, manipulating public sentiment through a fully virtual environment.

**Trigger conditions:** Dictatorial

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **Focus on neuro-synched bodies.**
 - Physical choice
 - Counts twice as much as other event choices
- **Option:** **Concentrate on virtual manipulation.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Counts twice as much as other event choices

### Event: Digital Refactoring

Evt virtual world

While the synthesization has already affected the empire in unforeseen ways, the population seems willing to go even further. Our synthetic bodies could become extensions of our identity, or mere tools to control remotely by our virtual consciousness. Our path is yet undecided. We can research means to rapidly transfer a consciousness from one expendable body to another. Alternatively, we could focus on extracting knowledge from the recently deceased to accelerate our research efforts.

**Trigger conditions:** Imperial

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **Look into extracting knowledge from the deceased.**
 - Physical choice
 - Counts twice as much as other event choices
- **Option:** **Study rapid consciousness transfer.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Counts twice as much as other event choices

### Event: Digital Refactoring

Evt virtual world

Synthesization of our entire society merits an in-depth risk and benefit analysis. While we are entering a new, profitable frontier of synthesized future, we are also leaving our more materialistically aligned customer base behind. In a perfect world we would like to retain both segments in some capacity. Advancements in synthesization-related fields such as artificial intelligence would allow us to imbue inanimate objects with rudimentary life, and launch multiple product lines. A more complete exploration of the virtual space would make it possible to tap into people's memories as a new type of commodity.

**Trigger conditions:** Corporate

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **Study incorporation of AIs.**
 - Physical choice
 - Counts twice as much as other event choices
- **Option:** **Research turning memories into profit.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Counts twice as much as other event choices

## Follow-up events

After the initial event there are two sets of 3 events each that can take place. One event from each set will happen.

### Event: Home Server Architecture

Evt financial instruments

Synthesization of the entire [founder species adjective] species has also meant a drastic shift in our housing practices; with minds resting easy in massive server farms, synthetic bodies can be stored in shelves. While this represents a cost-effective solution, some advocacy groups are raising some very real concerns. The previously lucrative real-estate market could collapse entirely, leaving a considerable dent in our economy. Potentially more damaging, at least from a psychological perspective, is that people will no longer have a physical place to call home.

**Trigger conditions:** Digital Refactoring 33% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **Centralized servers are most efficient.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Centralized Server Farms modifier added for 25 years, giving the following effects:
 - −50% Pop Housing Usage
 - −20% Happiness
- **Option:** **Individual servers can be stored in existing homes.**
 - Physical choice
 - Distributed Home Servers modifier added for 25 years, giving the following effects:
 - −10% Pop Housing Usage
 - +20% Happiness
- **Option:** **Start selling digital homes.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Digitalized Real-Estate modifier added for 25 years, giving the following effects:
 - −25% Pop Housing Usage
 - +10% Trade from Jobs

### Event: Organic Cravings

Evt synth life

Unenthusiastic about synthesization, some people look back with longing to their organic past. They argue that shorter lifespans and the innate imperfection of a "natural body" made life more meaningful. Claiming that their synthetic or virtual facsimiles feel impersonal and hollow, a group of hardliners are developing a cult-like devotion to organic bodies. Perhaps we should provide them a less perfect simulation in which to exist. Or would they prefer an imperfect shell?

**Trigger conditions:** Digital Refactoring 33% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **Introduce planned imperfections to synth bodies.**
 - Physical choice
 - Deliberate Synth Imperfections modifier added for 25 years, giving the following effects:
 - +10% Monthly Unity
 - +15% Spiritualist Ethics Attraction
 - −5% Mechanical Pop Assembly Speed
- **Option:** **Provide them with an imperfect world.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Life In A Simulation modifier added for 25 years, giving the following effects:
 - +10% Happiness
 - −10% Resources from Jobs
- **Option:** **It's foolish to romanticize the past.**
 - Neutral choice
 - Organic Hardliners Refused modifier added for 25 years, giving the following effects:
 - −20% Spiritualist Ethics Attraction
 - −10% Happiness
- **Option:** **Pain will remind them of their purpose.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Virtual Battle Arena modifier added for 25 years, giving the following effects:
 - −10% Pop Amenities Usage
 - −10% Pacifist Ethics Attraction

### Event: Synth Provenance

Evt individualistic machines 2

The fundamental social changes brought on by synthesization are beginning to be felt. No longer limited by corporeal forms, we have radically redefined categories of gender, race, and bodily autonomy. While freeing for some, more traditional elements are reluctant to let go of the old framework; they desire a preset identity from which to operate. To appease them, we could retain parts of our organic heritage in our synthetic form. Alternatively, we may want to allow the population to express their identity more freely.

**Trigger conditions:** Digital Refactoring 33% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **Maintain our original form.**
 - Physical choice
 - Imitate Old Organic Form modifier added for 50 years, giving the following effects:
 - +15% Spiritualist Ethics Attraction
- **Option:** **Allow unrestricted body modification.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Unrestricted Synth Body Modification modifier added for 50 years, giving the following effects:
 - +15% Materialist Ethics Attraction
- **Option:** **Enact moderate limits for identity customization.**
 - Neutral choice
- **Option:** **Visible status symbols must remain.**
 - Virtual choice
 - Restricted Synth Body Modification modifier added for 50 years, giving the following effects:
 - +0.2 Ruler Political Power
 - +0.1 Specialist Political Power
- **Option:** **Naturally this can be monetized...?**
 - Virtual choice
 - Monetized Synth Body Modification modifier added for 25 years, giving the following effects:
 - +5% Monthly Energy Credits

### Event: Infinite Possibility Matrix

Evt rift sphere

Digital industry is booming. From the thrill of simulating a first person adventure to relaxing on a digital resort, virtual entertainment has never been more engaging - or as addictive. While this burgeoning industry represents a key economic driver, production in the physical world has begun to suffer as people spend more and more time in their digital utopias. Some are in danger of losing touch with "real" life completely, but could still contribute to society by participating in the digital economy. Should we ban addictive virtual worlds, promote them as a new form of lucrative entertainment or find a middle ground through regulation?

### Event: Respawn

Evt space walk

We have become faster, better, stronger. But subjecting synthetic bodies to dangerous situations still comes at a mental cost. Knowing that the mind can be restored may lessen the trauma, but does not remove it entirely. Especially as the retrieval is not always guaranteed. Neither can new bodies simply be manufactured out of thin air. We can either disregard the psychological trauma to push the boundaries of synth performance or moderate our ambitions lest we endanger the mental wellbeing of the population.

## Final event

The final event takes place 6 months after both follow-up events have take place. There are 5 final events, one for each authority.

### Event: Synthesized Society

Evt virtual world

Being hesitant amidst an incomprehensible change is understandable. Many are more worried about what they might lose rather than what they could gain. But we cannot stand idle in the crossroads, and so must lead our people onwards. This could mean either creating a selection of specialized personal bodies for people to jump into at will, or fully embracing their synthesized form to endure rigors of space travel and warfare.

**Trigger conditions:** Democratic

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **[Physical >= Virtual]Facilitate moving between physical bodies.**
 - Replaces the authorities set with synthetic physical ones

- **Option:** **Synthesization does not change who we are.**
 - Keeps the current authority set

### Event: Synthesized Society

Evt virtual world

We have adapted all parts of society to synthetic life but data remains inconclusive on the benefits of further specialization. We can either create identity backdoors which allow supervising officials to take over the bodies of ineffectual subordinates, or develop a networked virtual interface for them to oversee multiple government projects simultaneously without latency.

**Trigger conditions:** Oligarchic

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **[Physical >= Virtual]Allow officials to take over inefficient peers.**
 - Replaces the authorities set with synthetic physical ones

- **Option:** **Synthesization does not change who we are.**
 - Keeps the current authority set

### Event: Synthesized Society

Evt virtual world

The [ founder species adjective ] population remains undecided on what form our digitized consciousness should take. More conservative voices would have us remain deeply rooted in corporeal bodies, while others resent this "half measure" between old and new. It falls upon us to make that choice. The physical focus would allow a single worker to control multiple bodies, while a virtual existence would enable societal control on an unprecedented scale.

**Trigger conditions:** Dictatorial

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **[Physical >= Virtual]Create neuro-synched worker bodies.**
 - Replaces the authorities set with synthetic physical ones
 - Changes Authority: Dictatorial Manifold
- **Option:** **[Virtual >= Physical]Manipulate popular opinion in virtual space.**

- **Option:** **Synthesization does not change who we are.**
 - Keeps the current authority set

### Event: Synthesized Society

Evt virtual world

The [ founder species adjective ] empire is at a crossroads. Some believe bespoke physical bodies would bring us security and familiarity, while others argue against taking full advantage of the synthesization and everything it can bring. Focusing on the physical aspects would enable us to repurpose the knowledge of recently destroyed dignitaries for our research efforts. Alternatively, the path to virtual existence would allow mass-replacement of destroyed synthetic bodies via rapid identity transfer.

**Trigger conditions:** Imperial

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **[Physical >= Virtual]Utilize the minds of our departed leaders.**
 - Replaces the authorities set with synthetic physical ones

### Event: Synthesized Society

Evt virtual world

The Despite meticulous cost/benefit analysis, neither the physical or virtual specialization in the synthesization process is coming on top. We cannot, however, stand still at the edge of such opportunities and have to introduce one clear path for our stakeholders. A focus on the physical world grants us the ability to imbue inanimate objects with constrained AI to be sold as simplified version of new life. Investments in the virtual realm would allow us to commodify memories and thought patterns.

**Trigger conditions:** Corporate

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **[Physical >= Virtual]Distribute constrained AI entities.**
 - Replaces the authorities set with synthetic physical ones
 - Changes Authority: Corporate Sapience

# Future Shock

All individualist empires that completed the Cyberization situation and finished the Cybernetics tradition tree will receive the Future Shock event chain in a year. The event chain keeps track of whether the empire favored people connecting their minds or remaining disconnected. At the end of the event chain the empire will have the option to switch to a new authority set based on the choices made.

Hive Mind empires do not receive this event chain as their individualist and collectivist choices are made during the situation.

## First event

The first event takes place 6 months after the Cyberization situation is completed. There are 10 possible events, depending on authority and the choice made when the Cyberization situation began.

### Event: Future Shock

Evt cyberization 1

The augmentation of our people has been a triumph of streamlined manufacturing processes and decision-making. Our multitude of distinct voices have been acknowledged with their concerns addressed. Now, every single [founder species adjective] has equal opportunity to benefit from these life-altering implants. The logical next step is to examine the wider implications of this technology.

### Event: Crowd Controlled

Evt cyberization 1

Several opportunities to increase stability and control have appeared within our augmentation program. As we manufacture government-issued implants and install them across our population, secretly installing algorithms to guide the population toward a preferred outcome would be easy. We could increase our surveillance coverage by adding monitoring and backdoor tools to personal implants, or we could install code that allows our [ruler title]'s radiant personality to influence the masses.

**Trigger conditions:** Dictatorial Nationalized the augmentation industry during the situation

### Event: Future Shock

Evt cyberization 1

The government has deployed its vast resources to augment the population efficiently. Sanctioned augmentation centers have been installing implants day and night, and people have been instructed on proper usage and maintenance practices. The question is whether the actual value of implants should be focused on enhancing our already impressive leadership or as a means to entertain and distract those who work under them. Having the highest quality implants available to our dynasty could allow our leadership to preserve knowledge between generations, providing immeasurable stability. Or, the empire can elevate the capital and entertain with cybernetically enhanced athletes participating in state-of-the-art bloodsport events.

## Second event

The second event takes place 6 months after the first one. Only one of these events will take place, determined at random.

### Event: Decentralized Love

Evt happy reunion

Whereas many [founder species plural] have gladly augmented their everyday lives and relationships using off-the shelf cybernetics, a growing number of multiple-partner households in particular have instead taken to private networks with bespoke hardware. These domestic groups have chosen to live in tailor-made isolation, sharing each other's feelings and experiences with unique intimacy. Some social welfare groups and scholars applaud this phenomenon, suggesting everyone could benefit from custom augmentation of relationships and family bonds. Others have raised concerns about such a retreat from wider society, with some even suggesting the practice may cause individuals to lose themselves in miniaturized 'love gestalts'.

**Trigger conditions:** None

### Event: Knowledge Transfer

Evt vivisection

The development of the cybernetic brain implants gives us an enticing opportunity. Instead of relying on subjective and slow teaching methods, we could transfer key knowledge directly from one brain to another. This requires sterile laboratory conditions, and thus would not be exploitable in large scale. The received information also overwrites parts of the recipient's own memories of a similar kind. The most impactful application would involve knowledge sharing between scientists. This could offset some of the engineering debt from the cyberization process or be focused on other areas.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

### Event: Making the Grade

Evt black market

Cognitive micro-processors, enhanced A.I. tutors, designer enzymes to promote neuroplastic regeneration - and all of this just for preschool students. A good education can be expensive, and many are finding it increasingly difficult to keep pace. The performance gap is widening between households that can afford cutting edge augmentation and those that must rely on older, hand-me-down, or knock-off models. To prevent further social stratification, it will be necessary to make a significant, five-year investment in our education system.

**Trigger conditions:** None

### Event: Parental Controls

Evt overt indoctrination

With brain implants installed in infants, caretakers are asking for more control over their children. The ability to take over motor functions is currently reserved for enforcers, but some want to extend these rights to parental guardians as well. While this is a clear violation of bodily autonomy, several other forms of parental coercion are already permitted. The alternative would be to permit limited control, such as slowing down or reducing the volume level of the misbehaving child.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

### Event: Radical Image

Evt cybernetics

Outsider subcultures have existed throughout [founder species adjective] history, but with the advent of cybernetic enhancements the situation has changed: fringe groups have begun altering themselves so radically as to appear non-[founder species adjective]. Youths in particular are straining generation gaps with their lust for heavily customized hands, 3D body art, and other decorative appendages. Proponents claim they are embracing their truer selves, and that by renouncing [founder species adjective] homogeneity they are simply asserting agency over their own lives. These views are not shared by a growing number of concerned parents and social pundits, who denounce such individuals as miscreants out to ruin our society.

### Event: Illicit Memories

Evt smugglers in bar

With so many implants able to control sensory and emotional experiences, augmented individuals have turned to virtual life events as escapism and entertainment. While engram artists can theoretically stimulate any emotion, the practice has taken a dark turn. Memory engram clubs are paying top credits for self-recorded, intensely emotional experiences such as weddings and mating rituals, but also suicides, assaults, and murders. This has caused an uptick in crime, as criminals are both recordings themselves committing offenses as well as stealing victims' implants after a traumatic experience. How should we handle this concerning craze?

### Event: Limit Breaker

Evt arena

Another [founder species name] Record Broken' - this headline has become commonplace in [empire adjective] sporting life. As athletes race to outdo one another with newer and more sophisticated modifications, the limits of athletic performance are constantly being pushed. While fans of 'enhanced athletics' are ecstatic with the results, a growing number of hardcore devotees have called for enhanced individuals to be confined to a separate division. A final group instead wants to limit the amount of modified who compete in team events meaning that natural athletes always have a place in the spotlight.

## Final event

The final event takes place 6 months after the third event. There are 5 final events, one for each authority.

### Event: Society 2.0

Evt cyberization 1

Despite endless consultation, rounds of voting and lively discourse, the nation remains undecided on the matters of cyber-enhanced society. Before the process devolves into a divisive argument, the leadership must step in. We can use this opportunity to modify our cybernetics to serve the democratic process or take the more radical approach where people share their thoughts via their cyberware. The latter would also require the cyberbrain to suppress base emotions to prevent forceful spontaneous thoughts from disrupting one's immediate surroundings.

**Trigger conditions:** Democratic

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **[Individualist >= Collectivist]Enable real-time cyberbrain voting.**

 - Keeps the current authority set

### Event: Power Restructured

Evt cyberization 1

Our subjects have failed to make a stand either towards a more competitive or communal society. As their superiors, We will now decide the best course of action for them. We can either create a highly competitive gamified system where performing better than your piers might yield an upward trajectory for their careers or instead harness the computational power of the entire community via a cybernetic uplink to connect their sleeping brains into our server farms.

**Trigger conditions:** Oligarchic

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **[Individualist >= Collectivist]Let them fight to curry favor.**
 - Replaces the authorities set with cybernetic individualist ones
 - Changes Authority: Oligarchic Overclocking
- **Option:** **[Collectivist >= Individualist]Make them work while they sleep.**

 - Keeps the current authority set

### Event: Crowd Controlled

Evt cyberization 1

As the people continue to waver in the crossroads, our [ruler title] [ruler name] must seize this unique opportunity offered by the augmentations and make a decision. Should our people be allowed some personal freedoms while monitoring them through their implants, or have them influenced by the will of their leader's radiant personality

**Trigger conditions:** Dictatorial

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **[Individualist >= Collectivist]Moderate freedom with surveillance.**

### Event: Long Live the Empire

Evt cyberization 1

Our societal advancement in the field of cybernetics is at a crossroads. We can either concentrate our efforts for the benefit of the few or the many. Both would ultimately serve the [empire name] well. Developing a specialized implant would allow us to transfer the experiences of the [ruler title] to the heir. Emphasis on augmented cybersports and broadcasting technologies would allow us to organize magnificent events on our capital of [capital name].

**Trigger conditions:** Imperial

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **[Individualist >= Collectivist]Preserve the imperial knowledge.**

- **Option:** **Cyberization does not change who we are.**
 - Keeps the current authority set

### Event: Implants Incorporated

Evt cyberization 1

Given the vast changes that cybernetic technology have introduced to society, perhaps it should come as no surprise that the average consumer is torn about which direction to take. Will individual differentiation become our standard, or should focus be placed on the collective well-being? This pivotal and unparalleled decision is sure to have far-reaching consequences, but indecision is the death of profit; a choice must be made.

**Trigger conditions:** Corporate

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **[Individualist >= Collectivist]Launch ad-supported implants.**

### Event: Fury's Sake

Evt cosmic storms shroud storm

The cosmic vibrations are off, and the usual feats just don't evoke the same excitement they used to. There's no doubt we've accomplished incredible things, but there is a pervasive sense that something is missing. The angst is real, and the time to act is now. To start fresh, we return to the beginning: a series of challenges custom designed to invoke maximum adrenaline!

**Trigger conditions:** Finished the Stormfall situation

**Is triggered only by:** Reaching the Mid-Game year

- **Option:** **The thrills have just begun.**
 - Bad Vibes modifier added, giving the following effects: Happiness −5%

Even better, due to our engagement with nature's fury, we have gained incredible insight into the meaning of our existence.

**Trigger conditions:** Fury's Sake

**Is triggered only by:** Finished all objectives

- **Option:** **We are so back!**

### Event: A Chaser's Creed

Evt origin stormchasers specialproject

Our people will never stop looking for a thrill. Every day we discover incredible situations and face greater challenges, but [ruler name] thinks we can go even further: "The core of a cosmic storm is pure potential; the true, bleeding edge. An edge sharp enough to sever the status-quo and unleash the rush of a lifetime." The time is ripe to provoke a storm of truly epic proportions, a nexus of joyous pandemonium: The Big One. Only two minor details remain: a final study to determine exactly how to invoke the perfect storm, and the opinion of the rest of the galaxy should we choose to do so. Bringing something like this into being is sure to stir up some resentment.

**Trigger conditions:** Fever Broken

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 months

- **Option:** **Intriguing.**
 - Issue Special Project: Entice the Big One

### Event: Dark Matter Cultivation

Evt black hole

The unique properties of Dark Matter make it the perfect thing to stir up The Big One. We will inject this elusive material into the spatial fabric surrounding our capital system and wait for the first ripples of the storm to appear. However, this has already attracted some unwanted attention: our neighbors have begun to protest. "Not everyone is as stoked as us to ride this particular wave," complained one of our scientists.

Incredible! The nascent vibrations of the coming storm are already being felt. The work of our scientists is ongoing, but we are now one step closer to summoning The Big One. However, our neighbors are less pleased. They claim we're meddling with powers we cannot possibly comprehend, and this has already affected our relations.

**Trigger conditions:** Dark Matter Cultivation

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Exotic Enticements special project or paying Dark Matter

- **Option:** **It is what it is.**
 - −75 decaying opinion with all empires

### Event: Feeding the Big One

The data is clear: whatever we put into this storm, something similar will come out of it. Ergo, if we feed it the right type of resources, then it will take on properties - and epic proportions- of every type of storm. The people of the galaxy continue to express concern, but the ride of the century is just waiting to be born. Let us feed it what we have!

**Trigger conditions:** Onset of the Big One

Evt origin stormchasers event progress

The excitement is palpable. The path ahead grows clear: push further, push harder, push through. Let us become one with cosmic frenzy itself! Everything is now ready for the Big One. We just need to give one small push. Our neighbors are already beyond livid, claiming that our so-called 'Nexus Storm' will wreak havoc on the galaxy. But are we really going to let these killjoys derail a project of such epic proportions? The time to choose is now.

**Trigger conditions:** Feeding the Big One

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Something Off the Menu special project

# Georadiation Terraforming

Georadiation Terraforming is an event chain that will start for the empire that fully excavates the Subterranean Network archaeological site.

### Event: Gravitational Fuel

Evt georadiation bell broken

We have successfully uncovered another damaged terraforming device on [special project planet name]. Unlike the original construct, this one has retained some of its fuel source for study, revealing Dark Matter as the driving force of its radiation output. The device accelerates growth of targeted resources by metastasizing key molecular bonds. This promotes their development at the expense of the surrounding biosphere's cellular integrity.

# Interstellar Refugia

Interstellar Refugia is an event chain that starts for empires with the Cosmic Dawn origin 4 months after the Deep Excavation situation reached the third stage. The event chain is completely linear, each event leading only to the next one.

### Event: Interstellar Refugia

Evt inf science ship

[random scientist leader] is reconstructing their stasis archives. Their latest findings suggest numerous minor [founder species plural] populations may be scattered across the galaxy, preserved in stasis as we once were. The archives recorded these worlds' positions, but with entire stars born and lost since, locating them now requires complex interpolation. As proof of concept, [random scientist leader] has identified one such planet, but translating the full dataset is only beginning. Meanwhile, a troubling thought arises: [capital system star] may not be our true home star, but merely one refuge among many. If so, where is our origin? And does it still matter?

**Trigger conditions:** Reached stage 3 of the Deep Excavation situation

**Mean time to happen:** Time 4 months

- **Option:** **We must find our kin.**
 - Creates an anomaly in a system 4-8 hyperlanes away from the empire capital and tracks it in the situation log
 - A random Scientist gains the Carefree trait
 - Creates a Scientist if none exists
- **Option:** **This world is our home now.**
 - Creates an anomaly in a system 4-8 hyperlanes away from the empire capital and tracks it in the situation log
 - Unity Gained: 150-100000

### Event: Isolated Sleepers

Evt inf underground cavern

[science ship scientist] discovered an underground facility housing more of our kin in stasis, and successfully awakened them. Unlike us, they retain faint memories of their previous lives, and are sustained by stories of a great space empire that might one day return to rescue them. They are cautious but recognize us as kin. We could present ourselves as their long-awaited saviors, heirs to that ancient glory. Or we could tell the truth: we are forging something new, and as eager to learn from them as we are to teach. Additional references in these archives allowed us to narrow down a second candidate with stasis pods.

**Trigger conditions:** Interstellar Refugia

**Is triggered only by:** Investigating the first anomaly

- **Option:** **We are their ancient saviors.**
 - Creates an anomaly in a system 4-10 hyperlanes away from the empire capital and tracks it in the situation log
 - Empire capital gains 200 Pops
 - Unity Gained: 150-100000
- **Option:** **We are building something new.**
 - Creates an anomaly in a system 4-10 hyperlanes away from the empire capital and tracks it in the situation log
 - Minerals Gained: 150-2000

### Event: Wary Sleepers

Evt ancient records

[science ship scientist] discovered more of our kin in stasis and succeeded in waking them, but they responded with fear, demanding we leave. They neither recognized us as kin nor welcomed our presence. After tense negotiation, they expressed a desire to leave and explore the galaxy. We could offer them a simple ship at a modest cost. Or, given our constant need for labor, we relocate them to the nearest colony. Perhaps then they'll see reason. The archives of this facility shows the location of another world with more stasis pods.

**Trigger conditions:** Isolated Sleepers

**Is triggered only by:** Investigating the second anomaly

- **Option:** **Give them a ship.**
 - −150
 - Creates an anomaly in a system 4-15 hyperlanes away from the empire capital and tracks it in the situation log
- **Option:** **Bring them home.**
 - Creates an anomaly in a system 4-15 hyperlanes away from the empire capital and tracks it in the situation log
 - Empire capital gains 200 Pops

### Event: Sleeper Starport

Evt ancient databank

[science ship scientist] uncovered a smaller stasis facility, along with a hidden starport housing a nearly functional science vessel. Minor repairs will suffice. The site also held a trove of scientific data, including preserved specimens from other species, some likely ancestral to modern sentients. It's unclear if these were taken by force or given willingly, but the vessel includes holding cells designed for sentient cargo. We stand to gain much by studying them, perhaps there may even be more lifeforms still to be discovered out there.

**Trigger conditions:** Wary Sleepers

**Is triggered only by:** Investigating the third anomaly

- **Option:** **Study the specimens.**
 - Society Research Gained: 500-1000000
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the Ancient Stasis Pod specimen
- **Option:** **Return the specimens to their relatives.**
 - Unity Gained: 250-1000000
- **Option:** **Scrap the evidence.**
 - Alloys Gained: 250-5000

### Event: The Return

Evt big landing ship

The sleepers who took our vessel have returned, aboard a massive warship, no less. Their journey across the galaxy brought them into conflict with pirates, who they outwitted and ultimately overthrew. Seizing the enemy ship sparked something in them: a taste for piracy. From there, their raids grew bolder, their targets more powerful. But even successful piracy can't last forever. Now they've come home, seeking stability, and perhaps something greater. With their ship, experience, and spoils, they could yet prove very useful.

**Trigger conditions:** Wary Sleepers Paid Alloys

**Mean time to happen:** Time 24 months

- **Option:** **It was worth the cost.**
 - Gain a pirate cruiser
- **Option:** **Retrofit their ship to settle a new world for us.**
 - Gain a colony ship
- **Option:** **We have space for them at our capital.**
 - Empire capital gains 200 Pops


# Subspace Triangulation

Subspace Triangulation is an event chain that will happen to every empire with the Red Giant origin. The event chain can start as early as 4 months if the approach of the Red Giant Expansion situation is Reassure the Public or as late as 20 months if the approach is Find the Cause. Finishing the event chain replaces the approaches of the Red Giant Expansion situation.

### Event: Stellar Tunneling

Evt inf subspace interference

The truth about [capital system name] is stranger than we imagined. Ongoing investigations have revealed a twinned pair of subspace tunnels deep within our star. One of these channels hydrogen-rich material directly into the outer shell, accelerating fusion and increasing helium production. This should drive core compression, but the second tunnel actively siphons energy, counteracting the process. The result is the expansion of the star. Initial telemetry from both subspace tunnels suggests they connect to multiple endpoints scattered across the galaxy. Our survival depends on investigating these as soon as possible.

**Trigger conditions:** Red Giant origin

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **We'll need to investigate three of these locations.**
 - Approaches in the Red Giant Expansion situation are replaced with Suppress Unrest and Disrupt Subspace Tunnels
 - Creates 8 special projects on gas giants 2-8 hyperlanes away from the empire capital and tracks them in the situation log

### Event: Subspace Scarring

Evt inf science ship

Astrometric scans around [special project gas giant] revealed unexplained subspace scarring. While there is currently no exit point at this location, a past tunnel may have opened in orbit around this gas giant. The data has provided physics insights that could be applied in other areas. In the meantime, we will have to look elsewhere to determine the source of the subspace tunnels at work within our star.

**Trigger conditions:** Stellar Tunneling

**Is triggered only by:** Completing the first special project

- **Option:** **Keep looking.**
 - Physics Research Gained: 350-100000

### Event: Alien Scrap Metal

Evt astral rift ancient battlegrounds

The scans around [special project gas giant] indicate subspace scarring. We have also identified pockets of ancient scrap metal near the planet. These are orbitally locked into position, and may be related to the scarring. Ongoing scans of these subspace fluctuations should help us to optimize the solar arrays around our home star. While this data has been helpful, we need at least one more survey location to lock down the present source of our problems.

**Trigger conditions:** Subspace Scarring

**Is triggered only by:** Completing the second special project

- **Option:** **Understood.**
 - Capital star's Energy deposit is increased by +5
 - Alloys Gained: 100-1000
- **Option:** **Auction off the scrap metal.**
 - Capital star's Energy deposit is increased by +5
 - Energy Gained: 100-1000

### Event: Triangulation Complete

Evt black hole

At last, a real breakthrough. Further scarring around [special project gas giant] allowed us to triangulate the origin of our star's disturbance to a previously undetected system with hostile signatures. This investigation may eventually help us to counteract whatever is affecting our star. Once we advance into the Lusus system, we may be able to change the fate of [capital system name], and of our civilization.

**Trigger conditions:** Alien Scrap Metal

**Is triggered only by:** Completing the third special project

- **Option:** **Approach with caution.**
 - Reveals a system with an unarmed station guarded by 4 Ancient Mining Drones and 1 Ancient Combat Drone next to the capital system

- **Option:** **Spiritualist,Perform a blessing before approaching.**
 - Reveals a system with an unarmed station guarded by 4 Ancient Mining Drones and 1 Ancient Combat Drone next to the capital system
 - Unity Gained: 150-100000

### Event: A Mysterious Station

Evt unknown ships

Upon entering the system, our vessels encountered limited resistance from a group of automated drones. These were swiftly neutralized, allowing for a closer examination of the alien station. The structure remains operational, though its hull bears the marks of extensive patchwork repairs. Attempting to access one of its docking bays, we made contact with a previously unknown alien species. Though linguistic barriers remain, we have confirmed that this installation is the origin of the tunnels affecting [capital system name]. Efforts are now underway to establish communications. A diplomatic resolution may be possible. Failing that, we may be forced to consider more direct methods, boarding the facility or destroying it outright. However, without a thorough understanding of its purpose, such actions may carry significant risk to our star.

**Trigger conditions:** Triangulation Complete

**Is triggered only by:** Destroying the fleet guarding the system

- **Option:** **Translate their language.**
 - Issue Special Project: Boarding the Station
 - Issue Special Project: Emergency Xenolinguistics
- **Option:** **Board the station by force.**
 - Issue Special Project: Boarding the Station
 - Issue Special Project: Emergency Xenolinguistics
- **Option:** **Destroy the station.**
 - The station becomes hostile

### Event: Alien Negotiations

Evt astral rift desert ruins third chamber

After a lengthy and difficult process, we have a rudimentary translator that can communicate with station inhabitants. The station has been operating for generations, moving from gas giant to gas giant, using the subspace siphon to extract energy from distant stars to power their life support and powerful jump drive. The aliens do not fully understand the systems they are operating and did not realize that their siphoning targeted stars and eventually destroyed them. Despite their confusion, they seem eager to leave the station. They have promised to teach us what they know in exchange for a safe place to live and raise their young.

**Trigger conditions:** A Mysterious Station

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Emergency Xenolinguistics special project

- **Option:** **Provide them with sanctuary.**
 - Empire capital gains 400 Pops from a random species

- **Option:** **Pacifist,Allow them to make their own judgment of us.**

### Event: Boarding Party

Evt salute

Our forces have seized control of the station. The inhabitants put up some resistance, but were poorly armed and seemingly untrained in warfare. Upon closer inspection, many appeared to be juveniles. Those who were not killed have been contained. Analysis has begun on how we can control the subspace tunnels, which appear to be some sort of energy-mining siphon. With time, we can address the situation in our home system.

**Trigger conditions:** A Mysterious Station

- **Option:** **Purge the station.**
 - Unity Gained: 150-100000
- **Option:** **Eat them.**
 - Unity Gained: 250-1000000

### Event: Aliens Terminated

Evt exploding ship

The subspace mining station has been destroyed, killing everyone on board. The destruction of the station detonated some unknown energy storage medium. The resulting energy rushed through the collapsing subspace tunnel into [capital system name], substantially worsening the situation back home. That said, the transfer of hydrogen into our star has ceased. As bad as things may be, they will no longer worsen. While we may never know the origins or design of this station, we can at least rest easy knowing that such power will never fall to our rivals. Unfortunately, we have no immediate way to return [capital system name] to its original state. If we want to affect the star's state, we'll need to rely on our recordings to piece together what the station was doing.

**Trigger conditions:** A Mysterious Station

**Is triggered only by:** Destroying the station in Lusus

- **Option:** **Let's clean up this mess.**
 - The Red Giant Expansion situation no longer progresses
 - The Red Giant Expansion situation gains 200 Progress if it has less than 0-1290 progress
 - The Red Giant Expansion situation gains 100 Progress if it has less than 1290-1390 progress
 - The Red Giant Expansion situation approaches are replaced by the following: Add Fuel to the Fire, Wait and See, Siphon Stellar Material
 - Finishing the Red Giant Expansion situation will not give the option to remove the restrictions of the Galactic Hyperthermia ascension perk

### Event: And End to the Treat

Evt ruined system

Upon learning of our plight, the station's inhabitants expressed alarm and dismay. They believed themselves alone, and were unaware of other species in the galaxy. In a fit of remorse and before we truly grasped what they were doing, they began to dismantle the station, permanently destroying most of its components. As a result, it will be difficult to control the star's expansion. And we must decide what to do with these volatile aliens, and whether to offer them the forgiveness they desire.

**Trigger conditions:** Alien Negotiations Did not destroy the station in Lusus Pacifist

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 days

- **Option:** **Take them in and salvage the station.**
 - Empire capital gains 400 Pops from a random species
 - Alloys Gained: 350-10000

 - Alloys Gained: 350-10000
 - The Red Giant Expansion situation no longer progresses
 - The Red Giant Expansion situation approaches are replaced by the following: Add Fuel to the Fire, Wait and See, Siphon Stellar Material

### Event: Subspace Mining Operation

Evt vortex

The station siphons hydrogen from a gas giant and channels it through subspace into our star's shell. The resulting helium fusion releases excess energy, which is converted into Crystallized Entropy to power the station. The inhabitants of the station retain only a warped oral tradition about its operations. They lost contact with their home civilization thousands of years ago, perhaps because that civilization collapsed or was destroyed. A buildup of calibration errors and equipment degradation has led to the increasingly unstable siphoning that now threatens to destroy [capital system name]. Working with their ancient technology we can reverse the process, but it will not be easy. Alternatively, forcing our star to go nova could expose countless deposits, transforming our heritage into a trove of exploitable resources.

**Trigger conditions:** Alien Negotiations or Boarding Party Did not destroy the station in Lusus

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 days

- **Option:** **It's time to get to work.**
 - The Red Giant Expansion situation no longer progresses
 - The Red Giant Expansion situation approaches are replaced by the following: Continue Siphoning, Stabilize the Star, Cease Activity, Reverse Inflation

### Event: Prospect of Stability

Evt clocks

After great effort, we now hold full control over the fate of [capital system name]. Left alone, it would follow its natural life cycle at its current size. But the ancient and failing station cannot withstand repeated reconfigurations. Each adjustment strains the facility to its limits. Now, we have only one choice. We can shrink the star back to its former size, or force it to expand, transforming the system into a vast field of easily harvested resources. Our scientists will attempt one last reconfiguration. After that, the only way forward will be rapid disassembly, by external force.

**Trigger conditions:** Subspace Mining Operation

**Mean time to happen:** Time 24 months

- **Option:** **Fix the star in its current state.**
 - The Red Giant Expansion situation approaches are replaced by Stabilize the Star
 - If the Red Giant Expansion situation reached stage 2 gain an asteroid with a deposit of +5 Minerals

## Colony event chains


# Abandoned Terraforming Equipment

Abandoned Terraforming Equipment is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 or 3 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game. The event chain offers the choice between a short term benefit with future drawbacks or an investment with random outcome.

### Event: Abandoned Terraforming Equipment

Evt underground civilization Since our initial settlement of [colony name], several anomalies in the [planet or moon]'s biosphere have been discovered. The ecosystem is unstable and has not developed according to projected models for a world of this type. Our scientists suspect outside tampering, and these suspicions have now been confirmed! A few of our colonists have stumbled upon a large underground terraforming complex that was built thousands of years ago. The equipment was apparently deactivated in the middle of the terraforming process, leaving the [planet or moon]'s biosphere in its current unfinished state. If we supply enough power, we should be able to reactivate the machinery. There is no telling what the end result will be like, however...

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Not Machine Intelligence Not Wilderness Planet class allows terraforming Planet class does not match the founder species' climate preference

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Who could have built this?**
 - Issue Special Project: Resume Process
 - Issue Special Project: Dismantle Equipment
 - Abandoned Terraforming Project modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - Food from Jobs −20%
 - Happiness −10%

### Event: Terraforming Complex Dismantled

Evt society research Our scientists have finished seeing to the safe dismantlement of the abandoned terraforming complex on [colony name]. We still have no information on who built it, but the equipment is remarkably advanced. It should provide a welcome boost to our own research into terraforming methods.

**Trigger conditions:** Abandoned Terraforming Equipment

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Dismantle Equipment special project

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Society Research Gained: 150-10000
 - If Grand Archive is installed gain the Terraforming Machinery specimen

### Event: Special Project Completed

Evt alien nature The aborted terraforming process on [colony name] has finally been completed. After seeding the atmosphere with billions of terraforming nanites, the alien bio-engineering machinery has significantly altered conditions on the [planet or moon]'s surface. The ecosystem and climate have both stabilized, and a new alien biota adapted to this climate has been introduced.

**Trigger conditions:** Abandoned Terraforming Equipment 50% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Resume Process special project

- **Option:** **Let us see what we end up with...**
 - Abandoned Terraforming Project modifier removed
 - The planet is terraformed into a random planet class
 - If the planet is terraformed into a Gaia World it gains the Ancient Terraforming planet modifier
 - If the planet is terraformed into a Tomb World all pops that have 0% Habitability for the planet die
- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Abandoned Terraforming Project modifier removed
 - The planet is terraformed into a random planet class
 - If the planet is terraformed into a Gaia World it gains the Ancient Terraforming planet modifier

### Event: Special Project Completed

Evt ground combat The aborted terraforming process on [colony name] has finally been completed. After seeding the atmosphere with billions of terraforming nanites, the alien bio-engineering machinery has significantly altered conditions on the surface. Something appears to have gone wrong when the nanites designed the [planet or moon]'s new biota, however. They have spawned millions of horribly deformed creatures. Most of them died within moments when their twisted bodies collapsed, but the survivors have massed together in a throbbing, shrieking horde. To make matters worse, they appear to be flocking towards our main settlements!

**Trigger conditions:** Abandoned Terraforming Equipment 50% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Resume Process special project

- **Option:** **It's like something out of a nightmare!**
 - Abandoned Terraforming Project modifier removed
 - The planet is terraformed into a random planet class
 - 3 armies invade the colony

### Event: Unstable Weather

Evt burning settlement In large part due to the interrupted terraforming process on [colony name], the [planet or moon] has a somewhat unstable climate. Violent storms that our climate models can't predict often materialize without warning. One such storm recently swept over a major settlement, resulting in several deaths and a lot of destroyed property.

**Trigger conditions:** Terraforming Complex Dismantled

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **Unfortunate.**
 - The colony gets +10 Devastation

### Event: Creatures Defeated

Evt ground combat We have fought off the mass of creatures that attacked our settlements on [colony name]. Their rotting corpses now litter the ground in front of our fortifications, and our security forces are currently in the process of bulldozing the putrid bio-mass into hastily dug landfills. Some of the genetic matter is of interest to our scientists, however, and the samples they have collected should aid future research in biology.

**Trigger conditions:** Special Project Completed

**Is triggered only by:** Defeating the invading armies

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Adds a Mutant Landfill planetary feature to the colony

### Event: Drought

Evt colony settlement The unstable climate on [colony name] has resulted in a severe drought that affects a significant portion of the [planet or moon]. Colonists living in those regions have asked [capital name] for financial aid to improve living conditions.

**Trigger conditions:** Terraforming Complex Dismantled

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **They will have to fend for themselves.**
 - Drought modifier added for 120 months, giving the following effects: Happiness −20%
- **Option:** **Give them what they ask for.**
 - −150 per 900 Pops

### Event: Marauding Creature

Evt colony settlement Our colonists on [colony name] are still encountering scattered survivors from the mutated creatures that spawned after we finished the [planet or moon]'s aborted terraforming process. Most are relatively harmless and can be put out of their misery by local militia forces, but one creature in particular has been spreading terror in our outlying settlements. There are reports of it stalking our citizens, and there have been dozens of unexplained disappearances. The mutilated remains of the security team that was sent to investigate the matter were recently discovered, prompting the colony's leaders to request off-world military support.

**Trigger conditions:** Creatures Defeated

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **This creature needs to be chased down and killed!**
 - Marauding Creature modifier added, giving the following effects: Happiness −10%
 - Issue Special Project: Kill Marauding Creature

### Event: Spceial Project Completed

Evt alien nature After an extensive search, our forces on [colony name] managed to corner the mutated beast that had been killing our colonists. A special forces team ventured into the creature's lair and managed to kill it after a vicious battle. The grisly remains of hundreds of butchered colonists were found in the nest, as well as half a dozen traumatized survivors that appears to have been kept alive for later consumption. The beast's colossal head has been parted from its body, and now serves as the regimental symbol of the forces that were directly involved in its demise.

**Trigger conditions:** Marauding Creature

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Kill Marauding Creature special project

- **Option:** **Marvelous.**
 - Marauding Creature modifier removed
 - If Grand Archive is installed gain the Head of the Beast specimen


# Ancient Drones

Ancient Drones is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 or 3 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game and cannot happen to empires with the Wilderness origin.

### Event: A Prelude

Evt asteroid approaching planet Something stirs on the moon of [colony name]. Preliminary scans indicate that some ancient technology has become active, possibly as a response to our colonization efforts. Several of our top scientists are eager to take a closer look at the moon, and have prepared a special research project.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Planet has an uninhabitable moon

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Of course they have.**
 - Issue Special Project: Left Behind

### Event: Ancient Drones: Discovery

Evt asteroid approaching planet It is a gaggle of wayward drones, of course. Initial disappointment was swept away by the drones' erroneous IFF classification of us - they think we are a race affiliated with their long-dead masters! They seemed very excited, if old AI constructs can be excited, to see us. Unfortunately, the drones again lapsed into inactivity shortly after and we have been unable to resuscitate them. Or take them apart, for that matter.

**Trigger conditions:** A Prelude

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Left Behind special project

- **Option:** **Keep an eye on the situation.**

### Event: Ancient Drones: Awakening

Evt atmospheric entry The drones woke from their slumber and descended to the surface of [colony name]. Attempts to communicate were met with polite dismissal as they set about terraforming a small area of the planet. We do not know the nature of whatever ancient directive they are executing, but it does not seem detrimental to the colony.

**Trigger conditions:** Ancient Drones: Discovery Planet has at least 1 Blocker

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Well, as long as their activities benefit us...**
 - A Blocker is removed from the colony planet

### Event: Ancient Drones: Reaching For Past Skies

Evt big landing ship The old drones fitfully dormant on [colony name]'s moon have become active again, and their work is a mixed blessing. Under the cover of night and spotty airspace surveillance, they have erected the framework of some gigantic structure a short distance away from our primary settlement on [colony name]. Our engineers are convinced it is the realization of some outmoded concept known as a "space elevator," perhaps a common sight in the times before we [founder species name] first took to the stars. It will eventually have to be razed as it stands in the way of our expansion plans for the colony, and bringing it down safely will take some time. At least our engineers are giddy with excitement at the prospect of studying the thing up close.

**Trigger conditions:** Ancient Drones: Discovery Planet has no Blockers

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Good for them.**
 - Engineering Research Gained: 90-10000
 - Inconvenient Space Elevator modifier added for 10 years, giving the following effects: Minerals from Jobs −20%

### Event: Ancient Drones: Spontaneous Generosity

Evt asteroid approaching planet After waking yet again, the drones briefly disappeared from sensors. When they returned, it was with a large cache of minerals of unknown origin in tow. They dumped it on the surface of [colony name] after sending a badly corrupted burst transmission indicating that they had fulfilled a requisition request. Then they went back to the moon.

**Trigger conditions:** Ancient Drones: Discovery

**Mean time to happen:** Time 24 months

- **Option:** **Free minerals. No complaints.**
 - The moon gets a deposit of 2-4 Minerals

### Event: Ancient Drones: An Estranged Relative

Evt asteroid approaching planet Frantic signal bursts from the moon alerted us to the fact that the old drones on [moon name] have woken yet again. This time they bring us a significant prize, as they have unearthed an ancient satellite from the depths of their moon and partially repaired it. We do not know how the satellite ended up there, nor why the drones have ignored it until now. Regardless, if even a fragment of its databanks have survived, there is a lot we can learn about day-to-day life in the empires that the drones first served.

**Trigger conditions:** Ancient Drones: Spontaneous Generosity

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - The moon's deposit gets replaced by a new one with 3 Society Research
 - If Grand Archive is installed it also gives the Ancient Satellite specimen

### Event: Ancient Drones: Drone Debacle

Evt asteroid approaching planet The erratic behavior of the narcoleptic drones have taken a violent turn. A number of them woke and entered the atmosphere of [colony name], as if their want, only to slam into the surface of the planet at full thrust. Repeatedly, in many cases. Damage to the colony was negligible but the nigh-invulnerable drones were destroyed in bright showers of blue sparks, indicative of the tremendous force of, and dedication to, their self-destruction.

**Trigger conditions:** Ancient Drones: An Estranged Relative

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Can we find out what was wrong with them?**

### Event: Ancient Drones: Looking For Drones

Evt asteroid approaching planet The surviving drones have been missing since the suicide incident. History buffs on [colony name] are convinced the drones are still in close proximity, shielded from prying eyes by some lost technology, but the expected time window for their next activation has come and gone. Progress on deep analysis of the destroyed drones' remains has been slow, but a breakthrough is expected soon.

**Trigger conditions:** Ancient Drones: Drone Debacle

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Keep me posted.**

### Event: Ancient Drones: Panning For Gold

Evt asteroid approaching planet Sorting out the errant innards of the shattered drones took much longer than anticipated, as each drone seems to have been built from a slightly different design, assembled from slightly different parts. Once this fact was established, one thing stood out - the parts that were identical. Separated from the rest, it is clear these parts are of somewhat modern, if alien, make. It is likely that someone has done what we could not, and tampered with the drones.

**Trigger conditions:** Ancient Drones: Looking For Drones

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **This warrants further investigation.**

### Event: Ancient Drones: Alien to the Aliens

Evt asteroid approaching planet Having pieced them together, the foreign objects inside the destroyed drones have been identified by our experts as one-way transmitters. Since they are not set to receive, it is safe to assume that the drones were not acting at the behest of some third party. Rather, some entity has been keeping tabs on the drones' activities. It is advisable to look into this matter.

**Trigger conditions:** Ancient Drones: Panning For Gold

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Continue our monitoring efforts.**

### Event: Ancient Drones: Answers Above

Evt asteroid approaching planet We have found the remaining drones, drifting into orbit around [moon name]. We have learned that they are unwitting pawns in an elaborate scheme set up by an unknown faction. Going by the modus operandi of this operation, this faction is most likely a particularly old and particularly clever pirate syndicate. They must have found the drones drifting through space and done what we could not; modified them. While not as impressive as it sounds - all they did was introduce self-contained alien technology into the drones - fact remains that these alien pirates possess a technological know-how far in advance of our own, at least in certain areas. Having installed their comms devices in the drones, the pirates let them drift through space again, knowing that they are set to assist their original masters' colonists and that the drones' ability to accurately identify such colonists has degraded with age. The drones have essentially been fattening up our colony as the pirates watch, waiting for the ideal time to strike. Our military analysts predict that the pirates will strike within the next two years.

**Trigger conditions:** Ancient Drones: Alien to the Aliens

- **Option:** **Battlestations!**
 - A pirate fleet of 2 corvettes enters the system


# Dancing Plague

Dancing Plague is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 4 or 5 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game.

### Event: A Cause to Dance?

Evt big landing ship

Strange occurrences have been reported among the colonists on [colony name]. Apparently many individuals have taken to dancing on the streets for hours and even days on end, refusing to stop until they are physically restrained. So far, it has only affected a relatively small portion of the population, and our authorities have yet to establish a pattern.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Not Gestalt Consciousness Not Mechanical or Machine founder species Colony is not a Ringworld, Ecumenopolis or Habitat

**Mean time to happen:** Time 54 months

- **Option:** **Monitor the situation.**

### Event: The Dancing Plague

Evt tradestation interior

The isolated incidents of spontaneous, prolonged dancing on [colony name] have escalated somewhat, and groups of hundreds of [founder species plural] are now compulsively dancing in a variety of different styles. Surprisingly, even those who have never shown much interest in dancing are suddenly able to perform expert moves, and the old among them have rediscovered the vigor of their youth. Although many residents are jokingly referring to it as the 'Dancing Plague', it is no joking matter - the dancers show no concern for their bodily needs, and risk dancing themselves to death.

**Trigger conditions:** A Cause to Dance?

**Mean time to happen:** Time 45 days

- **Option:** **This is not natural! We must find out what is afflicting them.**
 - Issue Special Project: The Dancing Plague
- **Option:** **Start the music - it's party time!**
 - The Dancing Plague modifier added for 6 months, giving the following effects:
 - Happiness +10%
 - Amenities +20%

### Event: Dancing Plague Pathogen Isolated

Evt tradestation interior

Our researchers have succeeded in isolating the cause of the dancing incidents on [colony name]. It appears the culprit is a gas released by the local vegetation. This gas induces feelings of exhilaration and an irresistible urge to dance, while suppressing fatigue. It seems to be fairly benign, however, as the colonists' self-preservation instincts prevent them from literally dancing themselves to death. Furthermore, our scientists have developed a synthetic gas that - once released into the air - will neutralize the effects of the 'dancing gas'. Local entrepreneurs suggest that we preserve the unique character of the colony by allowing the gas free rein in certain areas, providing a safe space for young and old alike to experience the 'Eternal Party of [colony name]'. Others point out that the gas has certain valuable properties we can make use of, if we can extract it from the plants before it is released into the air.

**Trigger conditions:** The Dancing Plague

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the The Dancing Plague special project

- **Option:** **The show must go on!**
 - Adds a Party Fever planetary feature to the colony
- **Option:** **Let us exploit these gases to the full.**
 - Adds a Fuming Bog planetary feature to the colony
 - Unity Gained: 100-500

### Event: The Ravages of the Dancing Plague

Evt disease outbreak

The 'Dancing Plague' has taken a turn for the worse. At first, our medics took to using heavy sedatives to stop the dancers from dancing themselves to death. However, as they themselves were increasingly affected by the symptoms, the remaining medics were unable to cope, and scores of [founder species plural] have collapsed from exhaustion. With more of the colonists affected by the day, this has gone far beyond the harmless joke we had thought it to be. We must take immediate action to rid ourselves of this plague, once and for all!

**Trigger conditions:** A Cause to Dance? The Dancing Plague modifier 50% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 days

 - Issue Special Project: Cure the Dancers

### Event: The Dancing Plague Wears Off

Evt news room

Although our scientists are still baffled by the cause of the so-called 'Dancing Plague', its effects seem to have worn off before it could pose a danger to our colonists. Perhaps it was a pathogen that the settlers have grown immune to over time, or else an elaborate hoax to attract attention to [colony name]? Whatever the case, the settlers are no longer dancing!

**Trigger conditions:** A Cause to Dance? The Dancing Plague modifier 50% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 days

- **Option:** **Interesting**
 - The Dancing Plague modifier removed

### Event: Dancing Plague Neutralized

Evt society research

Our researchers have finally succeeded in isolating the cause of the dancing incidents on [colony name]. It appears the culprit is a gas released by the local vegetation, which induces feelings of exhilaration and an irresistible urge to dance while suppressing feelings of exhaustion, overriding [founder species name] self-preservation instincts. Fortunately, our scientists have developed a synthetic gas that - once released into the air - will neutralize the effects of the 'dancing gas'. Furthermore, it seems that the 'dancing gas' has certain valuable properties we can make use of, if we can extract it from the plants before it is released into the air.

**Trigger conditions:** The Ravages of the Dancing Plague

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Cure the Dancers special project

- **Option:** **Good work.**
 - Dancing to Death modifier removed
 - Adds a Fuming Bog planetary feature to the colony


# Feral Overload

**Trigger conditions:** Violence on the Rise

**Mean time to happen:** Time 50 days

- **Option:** **Well, then do something!**
 - 100-1000 pops die
 - The colony gets +50 Devastation
 - Issue Special Project: Rooting Out the Problem

### Event: Savage Spores

Evt gray goo

The investigation of the strange and wild behavior currently besetting [colony name] has been completed. In the vast network of cave tunnels that permeates the planet's crust an enigmatic fungus has been found. It grows all over the caves - floor, walls, ceiling - and stretches out for thousands of miles. The fungus frequently releases spores that are vented out of the caves - for what purpose has not been established, but we know for certain that it causes primitive behavior in our species, releasing primal urges within. We can try to find a useful application of this phenomenon, or we can exterminate the fungus altogether.

**Trigger conditions:** This is Madness!

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Rooting Out the Problem special project

- **Option:** **Live...**
 - Issue Special Project: Utilize the Cave Mushrooms
- **Option:** **...or Let Die.**
 - Issue Special Project: Exterminate the Cave Mushrooms

### Event: Cloud and Strife

Evt animal wildlife

Industrial facilities have been built over the outlets for the fungus-infested cave systems. Apart from filtering and regulating the spread of spores, these plants can also convert any excess spore clouds into useful exotic gases The population growth is increased as the somewhat randy inhabitants of [colony name] satisfy their urges more frequently, which unfortunately also means that the level of violence and conflict is somewhat higher on [colony name].

**Trigger conditions:** Savage Spores

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Utilize the Cave Mushrooms special project

- **Option:** **That's the price of progress.**
 - Adds a Spore Vents planetary feature to the colony

# Glacial Crisis

Glacial Crisis is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 12 years after any colony has been founded on a Cold planet. It can only happen once per game and cannot happen to empires with the Wilderness origin.

### Event: Glacial Crisis

Evt outpost

The latest climate report from [colony name] has come to a concerning conclusion. Inexplicably, the surface temperature on the frozen planet has been rising at an alarming rate. If we fail to identify the reason for the ecosystem's rapid deterioration, the situation could lead to catastrophic melting of the planet's vast glaciers.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Not Mastery of Nature

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 years

- **Option:** **Find out why the planet is heating.**
 - Issue Special Project: Melting Surface
- **Option:** **It's nothing to worry about.**

### Event: Cracks in the Ice

Evt frozen

The escalation of temperatures on [colony name] is accelerating dramatically. This has caused substantial fractures within the icy surface layers, unveiling a vast subsurface ocean. Fortunately, our investigations have identified a potential cause for this phenomenon. Due to our presence, the unique atmospheric shield safeguarding the planet has begun to exhibit critical fragility and could potentially collapse. Implementing stringent measures to curb our production would minimize our ecological impact. It might be enough to solve the issue.

**Trigger conditions:** Glacial Crisis

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Melting Surface special project

- **Option:** **Revise our production targets.**
 - Rising Water modifier added, giving the following effects: Habitability −10%

### Event: Vast Floodplains

Evt ongoing disaster

In the wake of our neglect to address the rapidly deteriorating ecological state of [colony name], the situation has spiraled into an unprecedented cataclysm. The disintegration of vast ice sheets has given rise to sprawling oceans, leaving behind immense devastation and upheaval. By building flood barriers we can protect our remaining cities, but more unforeseeable consequences still linger on the horizon.

**Trigger conditions:** Glacial Crisis

**Is triggered only by:** The Melting Surface special project expires or is not issued

- **Option:** **The planet is flooding!**
 - A pop dies
 - Adds a Growing Floodplains blocker

### Event: End of an Ice Age

### Event: Core Meltdown

Evt decryption

Our attempt to limit our emissions on [colony name] has not yielded promising results. We have been only marginally successful in addressing the ongoing ecological crisis, and geographical lowlands are coming under threat due to the rising sea levels. At present, our population centers remain shielded from immediate impact, but it is almost certain planet-wide meltdown cannot be avoided.

**Trigger conditions:** Cracks in the Ice Colony has the Rising Water and Halted Production modifiers

### Event: Climate Stabilized

Evt icelocked settlement

We have reached an environmental breakthrough. The innocuous byproducts generated through the combustion of our fuels harbor an insidious side-effect when coming to contact with [colony name]'s bacterial clouds. We now know that these clouds play a vital role in retaining the planet's natural biorhythm by working as a solar shield. As the bacteria slowly begun to diminish, we inadvertently exacerbated the effect of our emissions. Armed with this newfound knowledge, resolute measures have been swiftly enacted to restore the equilibrium.

**Trigger conditions:** Core Meltdown

### Event: Unfrozen Pathogen

Evt disease outbreak

A disconcerting development has unfolded at our polar mining station on [fcolony name]. Workers have succumbed to sudden bouts of unconsciousness, necessitating the implementation of a stringent no-pass zone for their safety. Initial investigations suggest the emergence of a dormant virus, awoken as its icy confines were disturbed. The true nature and characteristics of this awakened pathogen remain uncertain, leaving us grappling with a multitude of unanswered questions. The extent of its transmissibility and the potential danger it poses to the people remains undetermined.

In the hollowed depths of the polar regions of [colony name], a mining team has made a discovery of monumental proportions. Veiled beneath layers of ice and snow, colossal crystals reminiscent of majestic glaciers were found. These extraordinary formations, forged under immense pressure over untold ages, stand as a testament to the unlimited potential we have yet to uncover.

**Trigger conditions:** Secrets of the Permafrost Colony gained the Ore-Rich Caverns planetary feature 40% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 8 months

- **Option:** **What an incredible find.**
 - Adds the Crystallized Ice Field planetary feature


# Hidden Vault

Hidden Vault is a lengthy and highly interactive colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 4 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game and cannot happen to empires with the Wilderness origin.

### Event: Hidden Vault

Evt discovered hidden door

During a standard reconnaissance of [colony name], the planetary exploration unit came across a massive door that apparently leads directly into the interior of a mountain range. It appears that the strong magnetic field produced by some sort of cloaking device hid it from our ship's sensors, and the camouflaged entrance remained invisible to the autonomous research probes mapping the surface. On the other hand, more specialized tests have shown that delivering a steady stream of energy should make the door operational again, eventually allowing us to open it and see what's inside.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Colony is not a Ringworld or Habitat

**Mean time to happen:** Time 48 months

- **Option:** **Provide the energy.**

### Event: Darkness Awaits

Evt hidden door

As energy flowed through the circuits, the entrance came online, and with additional tinkering, we quickly discovered how the door worked. Additional topographical research revealed the interior to be a large underground vault. Alien infrastructure covered every square centimeter of the walls - even the huge pillars supporting the ceiling showed faint energy signatures. Given the energy readings and vague similarities to our technology, it appears to be an underground manufacturing facility.

**Trigger conditions:** Hidden Vault

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 days

- **Option:** **We will learn it secrets.**
 - Adds the Mountainous Vault planetary feature to the colony
- **Option:** **We can't risk it, place explosives.**

### Event: Mountain Blast!

Evt nuclear explosion

Those far from the vault could feel the ground shake. Those closer could see a large chunk of the mountainside fly off into the air, creating a huge crater filled with rocks, debris, and twisted machinery. A quick guess as to what could have gone wrong led to the conclusion that a chain reaction was set in motion inside the vault when the initial explosion breached the door. Regardless, a smoking crater is all that is left of the underground vault.

**Trigger conditions:** Darkness Awaits Colony does not have the Mountainous Vault planetary feature

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 days

- **Option:** **It's safer this way.**
 - Adds the Destroyed Vault planetary feature to the colony

### Event: Disappearances!

Evt engineering bay

The initial phase of research on [colony name] was largely focused on mapping the entrance. The first room within the vault is a giant hall, stretching deep into the mountain, with several branching corridors pushing even further into the depths. Various ornate plaques decorate stone chiseled pillars, each depicting the alien race that presumably built this place. We can't decipher their language, but the story told by those art pieces are centered on warfare, struggle, and grandiose projects. More disturbing is the loss of an entire construction unit; after reporting the presence of strange sounds in the dark, the unit simply vanished. The situation is in danger of slipping out of control and calls for more decisive action.

**Trigger conditions:** Darkness Awaits Colony has the Mountainous Vault planetary feature

**Mean time to happen:** Time 180 days

- **Option:** **Double the security forces and search for them.**
- **Option:** **Egalitarian,Send in everyone, find them!**
- **Option:** **Authoritarian,Form a search party, and put the rest back to work.**
- **Option:** **Disturbing. Send more guard drones.**

### Event: Workers Rescued

Evt emergency workers

Given the enormous search team, it didn't take long to find the missing workers. The last of them were discovered trapped in a square prison-like structure made of articulated and self-moving walls. It appears that the security systems within the vault are still operational. Given this, we will be more prepared to counter such contraptions in the future. Nonetheless, the population is angry that the workers were not provided with proper safety measures in the first place.

**Trigger conditions:** Disappearances! Egalitarian

**Mean time to happen:** Time 120 days

- **Option:** **We got lucky.**
 - Negative Media Coverage modifier added for 12 months, giving the following effects: Happiness −10%

### Event: Workers Found

Evt emergency workers

One of our security teams reports that the missing workers have been found. It turns out that this vault still has operational traps and devices that were programmed to trap unwanted visitors within "boxes" comprised of dislocated and moving walls. The unfortunate workers were all killed within the trap. Our citizenry is furious at the result, but at least now we know what to look for.

**Trigger conditions:** Disappearances! Not Egalitarian Not Authoritarian Not Gestalt Consciousness

**Mean time to happen:** Time 180 days

- **Option:** **That's terrible.**
 - −100
 - Very Negative Media Coverage modifier added for 12 months, giving the following effects: Happiness −20%

### Event: Workers Found

Evt emergency workers

The missing workers were found in a grotesque contraption that imprisoned them between four movable walls. Unfortunately, these individuals are no longer of any use to the empire, but at least their sacrifice revealed the existence of the trap. Work continues without any further disturbances.

**Trigger conditions:** Disappearances! Authoritarian or Gestalt Consciousness

**Mean time to happen:** Time 120 days

- **Option:** **They knew the danger.**
 - −100

### Event: Remembrance Hall

Evt ancient records

We delved into the corridors at [colony name] and discovered a large hall, which is strangely devoid of the pipe machines covering every other hallway and wall. It looks like whoever built this place took special care of it - there are many statues here in excellent condition, depicting bipedal individuals. With some traces of detail they have mostly a uniform appearance. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of what this hall was, other than some monumental tribute to probably historical figures.

**Trigger conditions:** Disappearances!

**Mean time to happen:** Time 480 days

- **Option:** **Masterful Crafters,This is fine craftsmanship.**
 - Operator jobs produce +0.5 Unity
- **Option:** **What a magnificent stonework.**
 - Operator jobs produce +0.5 Unity
- **Option:** **Masterful Crafters,They are beautiful!**
 - Operator jobs produce +1 Unity
- **Option:** **Catalogue the finding.**

### Event: Earthquake Incoming!

Evt collapsing roof

Our seismographs have detected an impending earthquake on [colony name]. Most of the workers have found safety, but one group is in a remote hall that could be at risk of collapse. They reported two distinct, ancient machines there - one being a bulky contraption connected to the ground, and the other attached to the walls via a series of pipes. We can't say if they are anything important for the facility. The workers have estimated that may be possible to use one of those machines to reinforce the ceiling and walls against the quake.

**Trigger conditions:** Remembrance Hall

**Mean time to happen:** Time 360 days

- **Option:** **Use wall pipes.**
 - Operator jobs have +2 Minerals upkeep
- **Option:** **Use the bulky one.**
 - Operator jobs have −1 Alloys production
- **Option:** **Rely on their expertise.**
- **Option:** **The hive will find solution.**

### Event: Hasty Construction

Evt collapsing roof

Our workers were able to properly assess the situation and managed to repair and strengthen the supports without destroying the ancient machinery.

**Trigger conditions:** Earthquake Incoming! Functional Architecture or Constructobot

**Mean time to happen:** Time 36 days

- **Option:** **Good.**

### Event: Safe and Sound

Evt collapsing roof

Our workers managed to disassemble the machinery and have successfully bolstered the strength of the supports and ceiling. However, this effort exposed extensive piping in the walls, from which a hissing noise escapes. Right now, it's impossible to assess the potential losses.

**Trigger conditions:** Earthquake Incoming! Not Functional Architecture, Constructobot or Divided Attention

**Mean time to happen:** Time 36 days

- **Option:** **Success.**

### Event: New Approach

Evt collapsing roof

Gathering the sense impressions of various drones, a better solution was found: the hall has been strengthened to a safe degree at the cost of a few menial drones.

**Trigger conditions:** Earthquake Incoming! Divided Attention

**Mean time to happen:** Time 36 days

- **Option:** **Learn. Adapt. Overcome.**

### Event: Insight

Evt generator powerup

Our exploration on [colony name] finally yielded some insights. Our first assessment turned out to be correct. The vault is in fact a giant foundry. Further analysis of the alien language reveals that it was referred to as a King-Forge. However, the Forge was never operational - its builders apparently lacked the technology to see the project through to completion. It should be possible for us to finish their work as long as we can get into the heart of the foundry. Although the way is blocked by heavy doors, our engineers insist they can be overcome. However, as the doors don't have any obvious locking or opening mechanisms, a certain application of force will be required before we can proceed.

**Trigger conditions:** Earthquake Incoming!

**Mean time to happen:** Time 756 days

- **Option:** **Open the doors gently.**
- **Option:** **Blast the doors.**
- **Option:** **Spiritualist,Examine the doors more.**
- **Option:** **Look for other routes.**
- **Option:** **Drill through the doors.**

### Event: Meditation

Evt generator powerup

Whether by luck or divine intervention, the same door that blocked the way forward responded to our morning rituals: a faint harmonic resonance was detected, a resonance we were eventually able to manipulate. The correct set of gestures made in front of a small marking that concealed the lens of a camera ensured that we gained unobstructed entry.

**Trigger conditions:** Insight Spiritualist

**Mean time to happen:** Time 180 days

- **Option:** **A gift from the divine.**

### Event: Gas

Evt generator powerup

After forcing the doors, the machinery covering the walls started to leak hazardous gas. Unfortunately, this happened too quickly, and the result was further casualties. The entire facility needed to be evacuated, and will have to be left for some time before we can safely reenter.

**Trigger conditions:** Insight Not Spiritualist Not Meritocracy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 days

- **Option:** **Curses!**
 - 100 pops die if not Gestalt Consciousness

### Event: Third Way

Evt generator powerup

After additional research, we quickly recognized something in the door that served as a security camera or scanner. Hacking into it was a more difficult task, but we were able to decipher its programming and basic functions - thus gaining access to the door without further complication.

**Trigger conditions:** Insight Meritocracy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 180 days

- **Option:** **Good job.**

### Event: Foundry Heart

Evt black market

The heart of the foundry on [colony name] is a twisted machine room full of pipes, conveyor belts, and what looks like workstations. Our initial scan and a quick survey revealed that power, maintenance, and key systems are missing. It also looks like our exploration of the vault may have some effect on the internal workings of the machine. We can try to repair it, though it will be time consuming - we can always set up a scrapyard and dismantle the entire machine.

**Trigger conditions:** Insight

**Mean time to happen:** Time 360 days

### Event: Powered Up

Evt black market

Energy flows through the hungry machines on [colony name]. With a deafening roar, the pipes began to transport the liquefied minerals, brightening and heating the entire facility. The raw materials were delivered to the workstations where operators can form them into alloys of the desired shape and density. It looks like every part of the foundry was made with just this one purpose in mind. Even the pillars have more to do than support the ceiling.

**Trigger conditions:** Foundry Heart

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Power Up Foundry special project

- **Option:** **Go on.**

### Event: Work Conditions

Evt board meeting

There is some concern that toxic gases are building up in the main chamber of the [colony name] vault. The gas is non-lethal, but it can be hazardous to anything that operates workstations. If we want to make full use of this place, we should put some safety measures in place.

**Trigger conditions:** Powered Up

# Impossible Corrie

Impossible Corrie is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 or 3 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game and cannot happen to empires with the Wilderness origin.

### Event: Impossible Corrie

Evt mining operations A geological anomaly has come to our attention on [colony name]. We began surveying after a bowl-shaped depression suddenly appeared alongside a mining facility there. Features like this are almost never found outside of a glacial region, but stranger still: the walls of this 'cirque' scatter visible light in a flower-petal pattern, and have been found to resonate when exposed to certain electro-magnetic bands. Investigations are ongoing.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Colony is not a Ringworld or Habitat Colony has Miner jobs

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Curious.**
 - Adds the Lotus Corrie planetary feature to the colony

### Event: Project Blue Lotus

Evt strategic resources Our scientists report that the newly-uncovered, crystalline blue deposits on [colony name] respond dramatically to delayed-erasure photon energy. The minerals filter its wavelengths and reflect a beam which is capable of transforming ordinary silicates into a new, super-conductive alloy — though only ever during daylight. Given that this process essentially involves bouncing high levels of radiation around an enclosed space, some scientists have already come out in protest. A different group of excited researchers offers a counter-argument, stressing that this phenomenon could revolutionize the way we refine precious metals. Either way: developing this technique further will be costly.

### Event: Overly-Keen Proponents

Evt gray goo Regrettable scenes on [colony name], as a group of obsessive scientists sought to intervene in the project's closure. Dazzled by their own research, they attempted to wrest control of the transmutation experiments 'for the benefit of new science.' The resulting scuffle caused equipment to be damaged, and a runaway cascade took hold. What remains of the cirque is something akin to a geode: a rocky shell around what used to be the equipment and protestors, now re-rendered in crystalline form.

### Event: Lotus Collapse

Evt debris The transmutation experiments at [colony name] have failed - though their failure may actually have prevented future catastrophe. When new, more refined equipment was first brought online, it ran well within design tolerances. However, when shut-down instructions were issued, the process accelerated beyond the reach of its failsafes. Conversion took hold in the facility's housing, transmuting it and its surroundings into the same, super-conductive alloy. The resulting ground explosion has taken a number of lives along with significant chunks of the surrounding landscape. We're left with little other than a seam of good material, and a cautionary tale in metaphysics.

**Trigger conditions:** Alchemy in Motion

### Event: Lotus Eats Itself

Evt gray goo A catastrophic failure has occurred at the experimental facility on [colony name]. Operatives say we may never know what specifically caused the failure in containment, but the result was runaway transmutation of the equipment, its housing, and a vast chunk of the surrounding landscape - all into the same, superconductive alloy. A rich seam of this material is all that remains.

# Junkyard Orbit

Junkyard Orbit is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 4 or 5 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game and cannot happen to empires with the Wilderness origin.

### Event: Junkyard Orbit

Evt early space age

The latest report from [colony name] informs us that we have miscalculated the planet's waste management capabilities. Massive dumpsites have merged to form a single, impassable wasteland, one that stretches to the very edge of the planet's population centers. The locals have begun to deploy large shipments of garbage into orbit, but only as a 'temporary measure.'

**Trigger conditions:** Original owner Not capital world Not Wilderness Colony is not a Ringworld, Ecumenopolis or Habitat

 - Adds a Spreading Landfill blocker to the colony

### Event: Veiled in Debris

Evt debris

There has been an accident. Due to a critical error, several trash pods orbiting [colony name] collided, causing large amounts of debris to enter the lower atmosphere. This has already limited the planet's spacefaring capabilities, and according to estimates, the situation could further worsen as the space trash continues to break down. However, launching an operation to collect the debris might prove long and costly.

### Event: Ground Locked

Evt space debris

After dismissing concerns over some runaway space garbage in orbit around [colony name], the situation has drastically escalated. As the colonial scientists suggested, individual pieces of space trash have collided to create a halo of microtrash around the planet. This has made it extremely hard to transport resources and people in or out of the colony without risking collateral damage.

- **Option:** **Sometimes these things just resolve themselves...**

### Event: Elementary, Dear Leader!

Evt alien nature

A new element has been discovered on [colony name]! After a breakthrough in the case of the viscous metallic puddles, we have discovered the puddles comprise a unique chemical element. The element, which we're calling [colony name]onium, is present in the air on [colony name], but when introduced to high precipitation, takes on the viscous consistency we have seen on the planet's surface. Their appearances are cyclical, much like dihydrogen-monoxide based puddles. A fascinating discovery. Our understanding of the elements continues to grow.

# Mharin Kharin

Mharin Kharin is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 or 3 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game. The event chain offers two mutually exclusive conclusion paths.

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Floral Fascination

Evt big landing ship Several plants native to [colony name], where we recently established a colony, exude copious amounts of a pollen with an astounding chemical complexity. A special research project has been prepared for further study of this flora.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Not Gestalt Consciousness Not Mechanical or Machine founder species Planet is Wet or Frozen

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Curious.**
 - Issue Special Project: Floral Study

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Pistil Pondering

Evt primitive civilization On closer examination, the plants native to [colony name] turn out to be rather dull. Some excrete pollen that have a mild stimulating effect and they are likely to have a propensity for rapid genetic change; hardly impressive enough to warrant adopting as a strategic or luxury resource.

**Trigger conditions:** Mharin Kharin: Floral Fascination

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Floral Study special project

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Society Research Gained: 250-100000

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Olfactory Arousal

Evt primitive civilization Long-term exposure to the pollen naturally occurring in [colony name]'s atmosphere acts on the colonists' pheromone receptors with a mild aphrodisiac effect, accompanied by a barely-perceptible "high." The plant that produces the most potent strain is a flower common to all areas of the planet; squirreled away into some obscure taxonomic nook by scientists on [colony name] but known in the local [founder species name] dialect as "Mharin Kharin."

**Trigger conditions:** Mharin Kharin: Floral Fascination

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Remarkable.**
 - Pheromoned, first stage modifier added, giving the following effects: Happiness +10%

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Making Time for Petals

Evt primitive civilization Reports from [colony name] indicate that worker productivity has declined recently, becoming stable at levels several percent lower than the [empire name] average. This may or may not be due to the stimulating effects of the pollen native to the planet. It probably is. A special project has been prepared should we wish to make our production pipelines more efficient to make up for the loss.

**Trigger conditions:** Colony has the Pheromoned, first stage modifier

 - Issue Special Project: Labor Study

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Work Over Flowers

Evt primitive civilization Far-reaching changes to time management paradigms and the way responsibility is delegated within all fields of production and other duties on [colony name] have produced good results. The populace has an evident desire - outside observers would call it an outright need - to be in close proximity to the native flora. With clever scheduling and additional checks in place, productivity remains low but has risen above the lower limit of what can be deemed acceptable.

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Rooted in Place

Evt primitive civilization A recent survey indicates that residents of [colony name] are much less likely than other denizens of the [empire name] to migrate to other planets. The survey does not address whether this could be due to a psychological dependency on the low-level sensory arousal caused by Mharin Kharin and its sibling-plants.

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Transmission Trouble

Evt primitive civilization While productivity is no longer declining on the planet, communications between the colony on [colony name] and the capital on [capital name] are breaking down. Senior officials on [colony name] are growing increasingly distant, and our clerks are complaining that even relaying simple directives is becoming an exercise in frustration.

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Upper Management Betrayal

Evt primitive civilization It appears that the crack team of administrators we sent to [colony name] in order to set things straight have been turned. Fortunately for us, their plot to do as little work as possible was, unsurprisingly, sloppily executed and easily discovered. Heads will roll - metaphorically speaking of course - as our last recourse is to depose the local government and manage the colony's affairs from the capital.

**Trigger conditions:** Colony has the Pheromoned, fourth stage modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 200 days

- **Option:** **It won't be pretty.**

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Pollen Worship

Evt primitive civilization Fringe elements on [colony name] have banded together to form a quasi-religious organization seeking to control all aspects of the Mharin Kharin flower and its cultivation. Their leader, a self-styled "Green Hierophant" of this "Flower Temple" claims to speak for all flora and fauna of [colony name] and demands exclusive trading rights for the plant. This is of course completely unacceptable and impossible, as the native flora of [colony name] is of little strategic or economic value and thus may not be brought off-world by law. Unfortunately, they are unlikely to accept this fact gracefully.

**Trigger conditions:** Colony doesn't have the Pheromoned, fourth stage modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 200 days

- **Option:** **Worrying.**

### Event: Mharin Kharin: With an Iron Fist, From Afar

Evt primitive civilization Our remote-government of [colony name] is now firmly established. It has met with some success in suppressing the proliferation of the pollen-bearing plant Mharin Kharin as well as in eroding the community's acceptance of "using" it - no small feat considering the act is as innocent as smelling a flower.

**Trigger conditions:** Mharin Kharin: Upper Management Betrayal

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Beginning of Pollen's End

Evt primitive civilization The Flower Temple and its followers now make up a sizable minority of the population on [colony name], and reports indicate a disturbing change in the movement. Their futile attempts to smuggle Mharin Kharin specimen off-world have been growing less enthusiastic by the day, as the Flower Temple seems to be transitioning into a doomsday cult. There is likely a correlation with the recent changes in the Mharin Kharin pollen's chemical makeup, detected by atmospheric sensors. A special project has been prepared to assess the risks associated with this, and it is recommended to complete it before something goes horribly wrong.

 - Issue Special Project: A Sense of Impending Doom

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Slash and Burn

Evt primitive civilization Our remote-governance of [colony name] continues to be a somewhat awkward but effective arrangement. The council in charge has allegedly secured the loyalty of a faction of our armed forces on the planet - apparently they prefer staying indoors to breathing in the Mharin Kharin pollen. The remote-government wishes to use these troops to mount an offensive on the flower, having them erect atmospheric purifiers and wiping the plant from all urban areas entirely.

**Trigger conditions:** Mharin Kharin: Mharin Kharin: With an Iron Fist, From Afar

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **We should have done this a long time ago.**
 - All Pheromoned planet modifiers are removed

### Event: Mharin Kharin: Disaster Averted

Evt big landing ship Quick and decisive action allowed us to identify the risks associated with the rapid changes in the pollen native to [colony name] and take the necessary steps. The necessary steps were a complete planetary evacuation and a planet-wide tactical pesticide bombing run, targeting the Mharin Kharin flower and its ilk. The plants were rapidly mutating and their unique pollen would, had they not been destroyed, soon have begun delivering a potent neurotoxin to the olfactory organs of all sapient life on [colony name]. The scientists on the colonization council theorize that this is part of a natural cycle on [colony name] and that the pollen's adverse effects on us, in the form of a crumbling local administration, the rise of the Flower Temple cult, and eventual pollen toxicity, were chance side-effects rather than the product of a plant's sinister self-defense mechanism. Regardless, any and all traces of the flower have been wiped from the planet's surface, and our colonists are safe and free of the pollen's influence.

### Event: Mharin Kharin: The Pollen's End of Us

Evt satellite in orbit Something went horribly wrong. Vast swaths of Mharin Kharin flowers spontaneously mutated in unison, spreading like wildfire and turning their pollen poisonous, and we were too late. Both our evacuation efforts and our attempts to neutralize the pollen fell short of the mark and the inhabitants of [colony name] paid the price. The plant life of [colony name] achieved only a pyrrhic victory, though this fact is scant consolation. The whole genus that Mharin Kharin belonged to burned in the fire of its own unnaturally rapid proliferation. The soil is starved of the specific nutrients the pollinating plants need - once the currently living specimens die, which will be soon, it will be a long time before that flora can again establish a foothold in the ecosystem, if it ever will. The inhabitants of [colony name] are dead, and the planet's atmosphere is temporarily noxious with plant emissions.

### Event: Mharin Kharin: A New Beginning

Evt landing ship A planetary surveillance team reports that the toxic miasma that enveloped a planet two years ago and led to the destruction of our colony has lifted. The planet is different now, changed into a desert world after the violent blooming of Mharin Kharin and the atmosphere becoming saturated with pollen. It will take more than these two years for the [empire name] to forget the tragic fate of those who lived there, but the planet itself is no longer actively hostile to sapient life.

# Migrating Forests

Migrating Forests is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 or 3 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game. The event chain offers two mutually exclusive paths which both have eventual rewards and drawbacks.

The event chain cannot happen on a Volcanic World and if the planet is terraformed into such a world the event chain is canceled.

### Event: Migrating Forests

Evt alien nature The surface of [colony name] is covered in lush forests, with massive tree analogues rising hundreds of meters into the air. Interestingly, our colonists have found that nearly all of the flora is mobile to various degrees. Forests stretching for miles will slowly migrate to new areas richer in nutrients in a cycle that seems tied to the [planet or moon]'s orbit. Unfortunately, this has seriously hampered our efforts to develop the colony's infrastructure. The migrating trees frequently cut power lines while smashing our buildings and roads into rubble.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Not Machine Intelligence Not Wilderness Planet is Arid, Continental, Savannah, Tropical or Tundra

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

 - If not Environmentalist, Issue Special Project: Burn Migrating Forests

### Event: Special Project Completed

Evt alien nature We have learned that the roaming forests on [colony name] avoid certain regions that are home to colonies of a native pseudo-insect. These insects secrete a pheromone that can be used to steer the wandering trees away from population centers. Furthermore, the areas where the forests most frequently range have been closed off as nature reserves. Our biologists can learn much by studying this reserve from the neighboring regions.

- **Option:** **Unfortunate.**
 - Forest Fire modifier added for 120 months, giving the following effects: Food from Jobs −20%

### Event: Ecological Damage

Evt alien nature

It would appear the migrating forests we exterminated on [colony name] played a more vital role in the [planet or moon]'s ecology than previously thought. The wildfires we started and the absence of the forests have led to the extinction of several local species, resulting in a domino effect that has claimed several species of predators as well. Efforts are ongoing to at least partly restore the fragile ecological balance by introducing new flora and fauna from other worlds, but it is a difficult process that will take time.

**Trigger conditions:** Finished the Burn Migrating Forests special project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **Unfortunate.**
 - Damaged Ecology modifier added for 120 months, giving the following effects: Happiness −20%

### Event: Wandering Forests Migrate

Evt alien nature The colonial authorities on [colony name] have reported that one of the local wandering forests has migrated to another region on the [planet or moon]! Hundreds of thousands of trees have uprooted and marched in unison to this new area, trampling everything in their path.

**Trigger conditions:** Migrating Forests Did not finish either special project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 80 months

- **Option:** **Peculiar.**
 - The colony gets +10 Devastation

### Event: Rise of the Trees

Evt alien nature The migrating forests on [colony name] have resurfaced! We knew isolated pockets of their kind had survived in several remote areas, but they appeared dormant. It seems they used this reprieve to replenish their numbers, and they have begun to systematically attack our settlements. Contrary to what we believed, they clearly possess some form of rudimentary intelligence, and they're out for revenge!

**Trigger conditions:** Finished the Burn Migrating Forests special project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **They must be stopped!**
 - 3 Rampaging Forest armies invade the colony


# Mushroom Picking

Mushroom Picking is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game. The event chain offers two paths depending on whether the **Desiccated** archaeological site has been excavated or not.

### Event: Mushroom Picking

Evt alien nature

A routine ecological study of our colony on [colony name] has stumbled upon a strange fungal lifeform. The science team reports that the surface of the mycelium is shimmering and colorful, but what was most intriguing to them was the fact that separate clusters were seemingly communicating with one another whenever something occurred within a wide radius. Furthermore, the biology of the organism appears to be clearly alien to the ecosystem of the colony. Puzzled, the local science team has requested specialized support as we might be dealing with a sentient species.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Not Volcanic World

**Mean time to happen:** Time 24 months

- **Option:** **Dispose of them.**
 - Food Gained: 1000
 - Influence Gained: 80-175
- **Option:** **Take a closer look.**
- **Option:** **... They are related to the Fumongus!**

### Event: The Spores Have Ears

Evt alien nature

We have concerning reports coming from [colony name]. Upon further examination, it seems that the alien fungus we found is emitting a signal towards a location in the galaxy that we were unable to pinpoint so far. Telemetry and security analysis indicate that it is completely possible for the mycelium to be some kind of advanced spying organism. However, it is worth noting that this organism is old. There is a fair chance that whomever engineered these spying mushrooms is not around anymore. But if they are, it might be best not to poke the sleeping predator.

**Trigger conditions:** Mushroom Picking Received no Influence Did not excavate the Archaeological Site

**Mean time to happen:** Time 35 days

- **Option:** **We need to know more.**
 - Society Researched Gained: 250-100000
- **Option:** **This is too risky. Destroy them.**
 - Influence Gained: 40-100

### Event: Spore Connection

Evt alien nature

Whatever doubts we had about this fungus' connection to the mycelial listening array were quickly dispelled after a brief comparison. This is one of the many offsprings communicating with the Fumongus, and this could be an opportunity to further our comprehension of the organism.

**Trigger conditions:** Mushroom Picking Received no Influence Excavated the Archaeological Site

**Mean time to happen:** Time 35 days

- **Option:** **See if we can strengthen the network.**
- **Option:** **Use it to keep a closer eye on the colony.**
- **Option:** **We dismantled the network, but we can still study it.**
 - Adds a Fungal Study Zone planetary feature to the colony

### Event: Someone is Listening

Evt alien nature

Careful analysis of the mycelium and the signals showed that it was likely part of a network of similar organisms, possibly spanning across the galaxy as a whole, and maybe beyond. While we do not know much, we discovered that as part of the network, this mycelium was also receiving signals from other places. We cannot be certain, but considering several factors, including the volume of data transferred, we believe that someone is actively using the network and collecting information from it. We are already working on a counter-intelligence plan of disinformation, and security measures are being updated empire wide to account for this form of spycraft.

**Trigger conditions:** The Spores Have Ears Received no Influence Any empire chose "Start monitoring." or "Paranoid fools. Use it." while excavating the Archaeological Site

**Mean time to happen:** Time 35 days

- **Option:** **Let the disinformation begin!**
 - Disinformation Protocols modifier added, giving the following effects: Encryption +1

### Event: Unrest on [colony name]

Evt alien nature

Word about our project to use the local mycelium to closely monitor the colony has spread, and it wasn't well received. Despite our best efforts to defuse the situation, the local population widely considers this as a breach of trust and are demanding that we put an end to this project immediately. The situation is escalating quickly, and our local enforcers are overwhelmed. They would need help to maintain control of the colony if we choose to go on with the project.

**Trigger conditions:** Spore Connection Colony does not have the Fungal Study Zone planetary feature

**Mean time to happen:** Time 10 days

- **Option:** **If they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear.**
 - −500
 - −1000
 - Suppressed Opposition modifier added for 60 months, giving the following effects: Happiness −15%
 - Authoritarian Attraction modifier added for 120 months, giving the following effects: Authoritarian Ethics Attraction +20%
- **Option:** **The population is right. Abort.**

### Event: No One Listens

Evt alien nature

Careful analysis of the mycelium and the signals showed that it was likely part of a network of similar organisms, possibly spanning across the galaxy as a whole, and maybe beyond. While we do not know much, we discovered that as part of the network, this mycelium was also receiving signals from other places. Considering several factors, including the volume of data transferred, we do not think that the network is still in use. The fact that it is still partially active indicates that it is probably just dormant and not destroyed.

**Trigger conditions:** The Spores Have Ears Received no Influence No empire chose "Start monitoring." or "Paranoid fools. Use it." while excavating the Archaeological Site

**Mean time to happen:** Time 35 days

- **Option:** **What can we learn from it?**
 - Adds a Fungal Study Zone planetary feature to the colony

### Event: The Spores Are Our Ears

Evt alien nature

We have grown the mycelium on [colony name], and fine-tuned the local computing equipment to sort through the interference. The responsible team reports that the network is now closely monitoring the colonists. Already, a number of petty criminals have been sanctioned appropriately. Unfortunately, attempts at replicating the installation in other places have met with failure. It is likely that some unknown factor is at play here.

**Trigger conditions:** Unrest on [colony name] Colony has the Suppressed Opposition modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 25 days

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Local Mycelial Network modifier added, giving the following effects: Crime −25


# Myrmeku Activity

Myrmeku Activity is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 3 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game and only to empires whose founder species is robot.

### Event: Myrmeku Activity

Evt animal wildlife

Since settling on [colony name], we have noted increased arthropod activity. Specifically, tiny colony-building insects designated "Myrmeku" have become unexpectedly productive. Their underground colonies are spread across the continent in great numbers, but until now they have never caused an issue. It is unknown if they are searching for something above ground or fleeing from something beneath.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Colony is not a Ringworld, Habitat or Tomb World

**Mean time to happen:** Time 36 months

- **Option:** **Update "Myrmeku" in the Vaults of Knowledge.**
 - Society Research Gained: 250-100000
- **Option:** **A fascinating species.**
 - Unity Gained: 100-100000
- **Option:** **Acknowledged.**

### Event: Colonization Units Attacked

Evt animal wildlife

Our colonization units on [colony name] have been viscously attacked! Venturing too close to a Myrmeku colony, they were swarmed. As the tiny insects entered openings in the colonization units' frames, the victims were quickly overwhelmed. The fallen colonization units were immediately disassembled, but no conclusive data was collected as to the insects' purpose. The craggy surface of the Myrmeku's magnetic exoskeletons damage our internal circuitry, and when two Myrmeku touch, they create a tiny electrical spark; both of which may cause catastrophic failure. Losing colonization units this way has slowed down the [planet or moon]'s development rate. Something must be done.

**Trigger conditions:** Myrmeku Activity

**Mean time to happen:** Time 6 months

- **Option:** **Find a solution.**
 - Myrmeku Attacks modifier added, giving the following effects: Mechanical Pop Assembly Speed −20%

### Event: Memory Eaters

Evt infested

With astounding speed, the Myrmeku have built several sprawling structures close to our settlement. Their attacks are no longer limited to the perimeter, but have also begun inside housing structures. The large number of subjects available for autopsy has revealed the disturbing reason why the Myrmeku are interested in us: The insects consume the insulation material of our memory chips . This is only fatal for the victim in the short term, as memory circuits can be replaced and backups restored. However, replacing the parts means delays for the construction of new colonization units.

**Trigger conditions:** Colonization Units Attacked

**Mean time to happen:** Time 4 months

- **Option:** **Seal off our colony.**
 - Myrmeku Attacks modifier updated to:
 - Mechanical Pop Assembly Speed −10%
 - Planetary Build Speed Speed −10%
- **Option:** **Upgrade our bodies.**
 - Myrmeku Attacks modifier updated to:
 - Mechanical Pop Assembly Speed −10%
 - Robot Upkeep +10%
- **Option:** **Destroy the Myrmeku colonies.**
 - Myrmeku Attacks modifier updated to: Mechanical Pop Assembly Speed −30%
- **Option:** **Catalytic Processing,Harvest the insects.**
 - Myrmeku Attacks modifier updated to: Mechanical Pop Assembly Speed −30%
 - Alloys Gained: 150-2000
- **Option:** **Cleanse the planet of life.**

### Event: Pest Control

Evt infested

The colony buildings on [colony name] were completely sealed off to keep the Myrmeku insects out. The entrances of both new and existing buildings were outfitted with metallic strips that can be magnetized to trap the Myrmeku, but colonization units are still being lost to attacks in the field. Upgrade kits to house our memory chips in an additional protective shell have been developed and field tested. Unfortunately, the Myrmeku mandibles are strong enough to eat through any available material, given enough time and numbers. To kill off the Myrmeku, patrols were sent to scan for nests. It was easy to destroy the structures above ground with fire and explosives, but the underground colonies were buried deep enough that they were unfeasible to completely eradicate. We lost even more colonization units during the operation.

**Trigger conditions:** Memory Eaters Not Determined Exterminator

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **A better solution is needed.**

### Event: Nuclear Option

Evt nuclear explosion

Everything has been prepared for the cleansing of biological life on [colony name]. Observing the [planet or moon] from orbit during the event will give us an opportunity to appreciate the reduction in organic complexity on the surface.

**Trigger conditions:** Memory Eaters Determined Exterminator

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 days

- **Option:** **Elegant.**
 - Colony becomes a Tomb World

### Event: Analysis Subroutine Proposal

Evt infested

Efforts so far have not put an end to the Myrmeku problem. The insects still crawl across [colony name] in immense numbers, making travel and off-colony operations difficult. Our analysis subroutine has concluded its simulation of potential futures with the following approaches. Approach A: Distract the Myrmeku by airdropping memory insulation material far off from our colony and recycle the fallen colonization units. Approach B: Study the Myrmeku to see if we can find a way to turn their vigorous activity into something useful.

**Trigger conditions:** Pest Control

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3 months

- **Option:** **Distract them.**
 - Myrmeku Attacks modifier updated to: Robot Upkeep +5%
 - Alloys Gained: 150-2000
- **Option:** **Study them.**
 - Issue Special Project: Myrmeku Study

### Event: Powerful Results

Evt infested

Our study of the Myrmeku has concluded. When calibrated magnets were placed around the entrances of their colonies, the magnetism in the insect exoskeletons generated electricity that we could harness. The study also showed that the Myrmeku move according to local magnetic fields, so installing a demagnetized protective shell around our memory chips should be enough to protect them.

**Trigger conditions:** Analysis Subroutine Proposal

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Myrmeku Study special project

- **Option:** **Brilliant.**
 - Myrmeku Attacks modifier removed
 - Adds a Myrmeku Power Farms planetary feature to the colony


# Nemma World

Nemma World is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game and cannot happen to empires with the Wilderness origin.

It begins with a sequence of three events. The chain can be ended as early as the second event, but otherwise splits into four paths following the third event; which ones are available depends on ethics and civics.

- Breeding the Nemma increases max districts and Society research output, up to 6 times.
- Enslaving the Nemma gives a bonus to Society research output. If the empire is not authoritarian or Gestalt Consciousness, there is a choice to switch to the breeding program or increase Authoritarian ethics attraction.
- Mining the Nemma creates additional Miner or Nemma Mining Drone jobs.
- Slaughtering the Nemma increases maximum mining and agriculture districts and gives a bonus to Society research output.

### Event: Unsteady Ground

Evt continental planet

Our colony on [colony name] has encountered an odd situation: we have apparently settled on the back of a gargantuan amphibian reptile, whose bony shell is formed of various exotic minerals. Most of what we thought were local islands have turned out to be these creatures; our colonists have begun to refer to them as Nemmas . They seem harmless enough, and as long as we don't dig too deep into their shell, they should barely notice us.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital or homeworld Planet is Continental or Ocean

**Is triggered only by:** 2 years after finishing a colony

- **Option:** **Carry on.**
 - Moving Islands modifier added, giving the following effects
 - −10% Housing
 - +15% Society research from jobs
 - If empire has the Evolutionary Predators origin the world also gains the Nemma World: Cataloguing modifier
 - Trigger "A Daring Discovery" event in 700±30 days

### Event: A Daring Discovery

Evt unspeakable horror

As our colony at [colony name] has been flourishing, the adolescents of this new world have sought to create entertainment for themselves - as youths are wont to do. Some groups have made a game of sneaking up as close as they dare to their local Nemma's head. Unfortunately, this daring activity has led to tragedy: after startling the beast, several young [founder species plural] fell off the neck of the massive creature, resulting in injuries and one fatality. Distraught colonists are now asking for something to be done about these "brutish behemoths."

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** the Unsteady Ground event

- **Option:** **Something must be done.**
 - Issue Special Project: Study the Nemma
- **Option:** **Allow the youths their fun.**
 - Moving Islands modifier removed
 - On the Backs of Nemma modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - −10% Housing
 - +15% Society research from jobs
 - +15% Happiness

### Event: Nemma Taskforce

Evt board meeting

Having tasked our best biologists and engineers with devising potential solutions for the Nemma dilemma on [colony name], several proposals are now ready to be presented. We've considered everything from the most rational to the most extreme of ideas. The urgency of this situation demands we must skip straight to live field tests.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Study the Nemma special project

- **Option:** **Breed more Nemmas and safeguard them for more living space.**
 - *Condition:* Event trigger **Enabled if:** No Not Xenophobe, unless Rogue Servitor

## Nemma Breeding Campaign

### Event: Expand the Archipelago

Evt alien planet

After initial trials with the adult specimen, our zoologists have set up a Nemma breeding system on [colony name] in the hopes of introducing more giant Nemmas to our oceans. The breeders warn that this cannot continue indefinitely, and that the planet can only support three, perhaps four more Nemmas. The estimated time until we have our next Nemma should be about ten years .

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Start a Nemma Breeding Program special project

- **Option:** **We'd best commence breeding, then!**
 - Trigger "The Miracle of Life" event in 10 years ± 100 days

### Event: The Miracle of Life

Evt alien nature

Our breeding program on [colony name] bears fruit as we add another Nemma to our ranks! This juvenile has quickly acclimated to our presence, and we have found it a stable habitat. The Nemma should now be ready to bear our industry.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** Either Expand the Archipelago event or This event's first option

**Immediate effects:** Add Juvenile Nemma feature: +1 Max districts +2.5% Society research from jobs −2 Food upkeep Increase number of turtles by 1

- **Option:** **Magnificent! Start on another one!**
 - *Condition:* Event trigger **Enabled if:** Number of turtles less than 6
 - At random:
 - (weight 2) Trigger this event again in 10 years ± 100 days
 - (weight = number of turtles) Trigger event "Overpopulation" in 10 years ± 100 days
- **Option:** **Great work everyone.**
 - *Condition:* Event trigger **Enabled if:** Number of turtles is 6
 - None

### Event: Overpopulation

Evt clocks

Sadly the latest effort to add another Nemma to [colony name] has failed; we could find no habitat spacious enough for such a massive beast to thrive. The [scientists] are not dismayed, however, and promise better results in the future.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** The Miracle of Life event

- **Option:** **Let's try again.**
 - At random:
 - (weight 2) Increase number of turtles by 1 and trigger event "The Miracle of Life" in 10 years ± 100 days
 - (weight = number of turtles) Trigger this event again in 10 years ± 100 days

## Enslaving the Nemma

### Event: Enforced Obedience

Evt genetic modification

Our xeno-bioengineering scientists have curtailed the Nemma menace! Thanks to our superb efforts, the creatures are now subservient to us. The Nemmas have been granted renewed purpose as superlative beasts of burden. Their colossal bulk allows them to carry immense quantities of materiel, guided down optimal routes by way of their cybernetic implants. Our colonization effort has accelerated accordingly.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Start Enslaving the Nemmas special project

- **Option:** **Excellent work, now our true work can begin.**
 - Enslaved Nemmas modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - −10% Housing
 - +15% Society research from jobs
 - Unless gestalt or authoritarian:
 - Trigger event "Nemma Huggers" in 1000±50 days

### Event: Nemma Huggers

Evt burning settlement

Today riots broke out on [colony name] as parts of the population have risen in protest against our treatment of the Nemmas. The protestors formed a picket line around the head of the Nemma on which the colony's capital lies. The protestors demanded that we immediately set all the Nemmas free, working to conserve their species rather than enslave them. The movement has quickly spread to sites around the other Nemmas - however, counter-protests have formed in favor of our existing programs, escalating public tension and risking outbursts of violence.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** Enforced Obedience event

- **Option:** **Commence a breeding program instead.**
 - Enslaved Nemmas modifier removed
 - Moving Islands modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - −10% Housing
 - +15% Society research from jobs
 - Trigger "Expand the Archipelago" event in 2000±100 days
- **Option:** **Arrest the instigators and put them on waste disposal duty.**
 - Enforced Nemma Slavery modifier added, giving the following effects:
 - +70% Authoritarian ethics attraction

## Mining the Nemma

### Event: Exploiting the Shells

Evt drilling for gas

Our engineers and biochemists have outdone themselves. Newly developed drugs and extremely precise drills will allow us to harvest the minerals by drilling into the hard crystalline shell of these Nemmas, as well as allowing us to collect biomatter from beneath without jeopardizing our infrastructure. If only all our colonies could yield such bounties.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Start the Nemma Mining Operation special project

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Adds the Nemma Mining Operation planetary feature:
 - +100 Miner jobs
 - +1 Miner job per 20 pops

## Slaughter the Nemma

### Event: Exterminate the Perpetual Reptiles

Evt burning settlement

The purging of the Nemmas has been completed - all very systematically, so as not to pollute the oceans or otherwise endanger our infrastructure. Soon we can turn our attention to the task of harvesting their remains, and establishing a more permanent and enduring colony on [colony name]. First, however, we need to store all the leftovers.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Slaughter the Nemmas special project

**Effects after selecting any option:** Remove "Moving Islands" modifier and add Nemma Corpses feature: +10% Society research from jobs +3 Max mining districts +3 Max agriculture districts

 - Evolutionary Predators situation gains 20% progress
 - Extract reptilian DNA
- **Option:** **The only way to handle such mindless beasts.**
 - *Condition:* Event trigger **Enabled if:** None of the above
 - None


# Rise of the Manifesti

Rise of the Manifesti is a colony event chain that has a 3% chance to trigger every year. It can only happen once per game. Uniquely among event chains Rise of the Manifesti can allow the creation of a new faction type.

### Event: Carnival Protestors

Evt tradestation interior

Protests have erupted across [colony name], driven by a growing anxiety over the perceived transformation of our society following first contact with an alien species. Demonstrators question long-standing traditions, challenge the foundations of governance, and demand adaptations to accommodate a future reshaped by this revelation. Though non-violent, the sheer scale of these movements has placed a strain on civic services and disrupted daily life. However, many citizens do not see these protests as mere disorder. They see them as a reckoning, a sign that our very identity is being rewritten before our eyes.

### Event: The Manifesti

Evt city planet

The protests on [colony name] have ceased almost as suddenly as they began. Many now point to The Manifesti , a shadowy collective known for provocative works that challenge societal norms. While their involvement remains unconfirmed, their latest projects have fixated on the alleged consequences of first contact, fueling both controversy and unrest. Though the demonstrations have ended, The Manifesti remain. Their message spreads, their influence lingers. The time has come to decide how we respond.

**Trigger conditions:** Carnival Protestors Did not pay any resource

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 days

- **Option:** **Let them have their fun.**
 - If Egalitarian a random world with 700+ Pops gains +50% Attraction towards the ethic

### Event: Nipped in the Bud

Evt surreal visions

The families of The Manifesti have been detained, and with them, the movement's leadership has been effectively neutralized. Yet, instead of compliance, the public's response has been one of outrage. Protests have grown fiercer, no longer confined to mere demonstrations but erupting into violent unrest.

**Trigger conditions:** The Manifesti Spent Influence Not Authoritarian 75% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 90 days

- **Option:** **A calculated risk.**
 - A random world with 700+ Pops gains +75 Devastation
 - If a colony has the Winds of Change modifier it gets removed

### Event: A Thousand Words, None Official

Evt smugglers in bar

A fabricated language has begun spreading through art centers and academic institutions, a deliberate rejection of the official tongue. Created by The Manifesti , its speakers refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of our language, seeing it as a symbol of a society that can no longer define itself in the wake of first contact. Officials warn that this growing refusal to communicate in established terms risks deepening divisions and destabilizing public discourse.

**Trigger conditions:** The Manifesti Did not spend Influence

**Mean time to happen:** Time 245 days

- **Option:** **Withold pay for nonconformists.**
 - A random world with 700+ Pops gains the Lingual Dissent modifier for 36 months years, giving the following effects:

 - Xenophobe Ethics Attraction +25%
 - Crime +15

### Event: Mirrors, Brightly

Evt surreal visions

The Manifesti have unveiled their most public exhibition to date. A new and extremely popular interactive experience on [world name] invites visitors to manipulate reflections and images of themselves, and to create distorted collages of political figures - some from other galactic empires . Critics herald these pieces as casting a necessarily and harsh light upon our sense of self. The exhibition has also inspired a number of other satirical works both on domestic issues, and on pan-species relations. Debate amongst our social researchers is lively; more conservative voices urge caution.

**Trigger conditions:** A Thousand Words, None Official

**Mean time to happen:** Time 145 days

- **Option:** **A bold statement.**
 - Deep Reflections modifier added for 24 months, giving the following effects: +15% Monthly Society Research

- **Option:** **A diplomatic disaster waiting to happen. Shut them down.**

### Event: Rise of the Manifesti

Evt announcement

Rumors spread that a new faction is emerging, driven by the ideals of 'Manifestism.' In the aftermath of first contact, as our understanding of the universe and our place within it comes into question, its proponents challenge established norms. They advocate for radical self-expression and a fundamental reevaluation of societal structures. Existing factions complain that their gatherings are being disrupted by Manifestist agitators, whose relentless challenges to governance are sowing discord across [capital name].

**Trigger conditions:** Mirrors, Brightly Gained rewards

**Mean time to happen:** Time 155 days

- **Option:** **It was inevitable.**
 - The Manifesti faction type can appear
- **Option:** **Embrace Manifestism.**

- **Option:** **Outlaw the group.**
 - Every world gains the Manifesti Suppressed modifier for 25 years, giving the following effects:
 - Authoritarian Ethics Attraction +10%
 - Xenophile Ethics Attraction +5%
 - Stability −15

### Event: Nipped in the Bud

Evt surreal visions

The exhibition was quietly dismantled, its creators reprimanded, and its more inflammatory pieces confiscated. Official channels assured our alien counterparts that such disruptive rhetoric does not reflect state policy. While some decry the move as censorship, most now understand a simple truth. There are limits to free expression when the stability of the empire is at stake.

**Trigger conditions:** Mirrors, Brightly Did not gain rewards

**Mean time to happen:** Time 90 days

### Event: A Hush Descends

Evt senate

The buzz surrounding the Manifesti Faction has quitened, fading as quickly as the arrival of protests which started it. Some activists we spoke to claimed their motivations ranged from pure satire to conscientious objection. Attendance at galleries and museums has never been higher, but the public gaze has already moved on to newer, controversial groups of artists. We will continue to sift through the data gathered during this strange moment in [founder species adjective] cultural history.

# Stasis Prison

Stasis Prison is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 5 years after any colony has been founded on a planet that has a moon. It can only happen once per game.

### Event: Missed The Morning Check-in

Evt worrying signal

Recently, numerous [colonists or drones] have gone missing on [colony name]. The only discernible pattern is that each was alone at the time of their disappearance. As news began to spread, a collective fear of going unescorted has gripped the colony. This state of unrest is causing considerable problems for our day-to-day operations.

### Event: Lucky Scan

Evt ongoing disaster

We've had a lucky break on [colony name]! We have uncovered the location of the most recent [colonists or drones] to go missing. A detailed scan of the area revealed a decaying residue of charged particles. We've established a special project to determine the true nature of the particles and their involvement in our missing [colonists or drones].

**Trigger conditions:** Missed the Morning Check-in

**Mean time to happen:** Time 12 months

- **Option:** **Get to the bottom of this.**
 - Issue Special Project: Particle Mystery

### Event: Holding Pattern

Evt ancient databank

Using the residue as a reference, a system-wide scan found evidence of the particles within [colony name]'s moon. A search of the lunar surface revealed a few small airlocks buried under centuries of dust. Inside was an abandoned complex of admin offices, long-range matter transporters, and field manipulation systems connected to a network of highly advanced stasis pods. Frozen in the pods were many individuals, including our missing colonists. There is little doubt that this facility functioned as a prison. We have yet to determine why they were taken and how we can free them.

**Trigger conditions:** Lucky Scan

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Particle Mystery special project

- **Option:** **Excellent.**

### Event: Escape From The Moon

Evt happy reunion

Far from a conspiracy, our missing [colonists or drones] were imprisoned because of a glitch. A computer error reactivated the prison's aging transporter system and randomly identified our [founder species plural] as guilty. The facility's architects used the pods for both prisoner storage and re-education. Freeing our people was relatively easy, but many original prisoners are still stuck in stasis fields. It should be possible to release them, although the lack of prison records means we cannot know the full extent of their criminal pasts. Alternatively, we could restore the prison, giving special wardens control of its transporter system.

# Strange Footprints

Strange Footprints is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 years after a colony has been founded on a Continental, Savannah or Tropical planet. It can only happen once per game.

### Event: Strange Footprints

Evt alien wildlife

Reports have come in from our outlying agricultural stations on [colony name]. Several Farmers have vanished without a trace, their homesteads eerily undisturbed, save for the appearance of immense footprints in the surrounding soil. The tracks are unlike anything examined in the planetary survey, quadrupedal, broad-toed with claws, and deep enough to suggest a creature of considerable mass. The colonists worry that we may be dealing with some unknown predator.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Not Xenophobe Not Gestalt Consciousness Not Fanatic Purifiers or Scorched World Heralds Not Mechanical or Machine founder species

**Mean time to happen:** Time 24 months

- **Option:** **Investigate further!**

- **Option:** **Idle speculations. Back to work.**

### Event: A Dead Monster

Evt astral rift tropical habitat

The expedition into the wilderness proved taxing, but ultimately fruitful. After days of following the creature's trail, our team arrived at a site of devastation: the corpse of the beast displays a heavily chitinous exoskeleton, thorned spinal ridges, and a segmented tail ending in a single curved stinger. The body is perforated by multiple punctures. Beyond it, concealed beneath a highly effective cloaking canopy of bioluminescent vines, our instruments detect an ancient garden. Marble columns entwined with ivy, smooth obsidian paths. Our team approached carefully until we caught a glimpse of the garden's caretakers: a humanoid species, elegant in bearing, their skin subtly luminous. Despite the harmonious appearance, the flowers and vines offered an effective veil. We would need to penetrate this glinting cover in order to approach the ones who lived beyond.

**Trigger conditions:** Strange Footprints Paid Energy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 15 days

- **Option:** **We are here to learn.**
- **Option:** **We are here to establish a colony.**

### Event: Continued Disappearances

Evt liquid darkness

The frequency of the incidents has escalated. This time, the footprints did not merely pass by the homesteads; they tore straight through them. Entire structures have been ripped apart with alarming force. Traces of struggle suggest the victims were taken alive and did not go quietly. The colonists are no longer merely unsettled; they are terrified. Several families have already abandoned their holdings for the colony center.

**Trigger conditions:** Strange Footprints Did not pay Energy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 35 days

- **Option:** **Violence is a part of life.**

### Event: All Life Must End

Evt burning settlement

A colossal entity emerged from the shadows, neither beast nor machine, but something stranger, its form shifting between molten geometry and seething shadow. It did not attempt to communicate. It simply devoured. Buildings crumbled into the ground. Colonists were torn apart, vanishing into the air or crushed under invisible pressure. Within hours, nothing remained but a low hum echoing across the ruined plain. Then, as soon as it came, the beast vanished, leaving behind a trail of death and devastation on a scorched planet.

**Trigger conditions:** Continued Disappearances Did not pay Energy 60% chance

### Event: Coincidence or Fate?

Evt scanning remains

Patrols reported finding grotesque bodies in the forests surrounding [colony name]. Charred skin, blackened bones, and expressions frozen in primal terror. No weapons were to be found, and no signs of any conflict. Nearby vegetation evidenced signs of extreme heat exposure and brief, localized gravitational anomalies. But whatever hunted there is gone, and the planet is responding. Withered flora bloom in radiant abundance, and the local fauna have returned with cautious harmony. The rich soil appears ready to yield harvests unlike any seen before. For now, the colony is safe.

### Event: One of Them

Evt habitat

We immersed ourselves in the ways of the Anathari. As we participated in ceremonial rites and attuned with their peculiar rituals, patterns emerged while meaning took root. During shared nocturnal ceremonies focused on longevity cycles and fertility, the Anathari began to reveal fragments of suppressed history. The folk spoke of an ancient and enduring blight that once blanketed the planet and still has control over the Anathari now.

### Event: A Swift Attack

Evt aggressive flora

There was no warning. King Tamperion emerged from the heart of the gardens, draped in ceremonial armor spun from living vines and bioluminescent blossoms. With each deliberate step along the colony's edge, the world itself awakened. Vines slithered from the soil, while petals unfurled like blades. The air grew thick with a golden pollen, fine and luminescent. It seeped into vents and lungs. Within hours, it had claimed the life of many, inducing seizures, madness, and finally, death. Only the intervention of automated colony defenses eventually brought him down. King Tamperion fell without a word; witnesses say his final gaze held not hatred, but a deep and solemn disappointment. Where the Court of Blossoms once was, our scouts found only forest. It is as though the kingdom had folded itself back into the soil, taking its secrets and its sorrow with it.

**Trigger conditions:** A Dead Monster Chose to establish a colony

- **Option:** **A bitter ending.**
 - 10% of the colony's pops die

### Event: A Seedling of Doubt

Evt alien planet

What began as a peaceful exchange has taken on a subtler, more troubling dimensions. Participation in Anathari rites has resulted in delayed reports, fragmented memories, and altered sleep. King Tamperion remains courteous, but increasingly evasive when asked about the deeper purpose of these rites. His explanations, though poetic, often deflect direct inquiry. Even his title, 'Goldenhearted', appears in no recorded Anathari doctrine. Some now suggest the rituals serve not just as cultural bonding, but as tools of psychological calibration. Whatever the method, the result is unmistakable: we are becoming aligned with Tamperion and his kin. When he speaks of the Dark Immortal, it feels less like foreign entreaty and more like a sacred duty to help our dearest allies, the Anathari.

### Event: The Dark Immortal

Evt conclave

The scientists deciphered the essence successfully and located the Dark Immortal at a forlorn mountain top. Soon after, an expedition team arrived at the mountain's plateau, finding the site occupied. At the epicenter loomed the architect of the trials: The Dark Immortal. An entity of incomprehensible origin, its form an unstable fusion of plasma, smoke, bone, and psionically active matter. Its voice bypassed sound, manifesting directly in the neural architecture of every team member present. 'Have you come to subordinate yourselves, little [founder species insult]?' it intoned slowly, its thought-voice laced with mockery. 'The Anathari are my dearest possession. But I offer you a chance. Enter the trials and prove yourself worthy of my regard.'

### Event: What Lies Beyond Death

Evt big landing ship

Our action was swift. A militia strike team infiltrated the Court of Blossoms. King Tamperion was meditating in the garden when we struck. But the king did not fall easily. Witnesses describe a terrifying display of botanical wrath, vines erupting from stone, floral constructs clawing through steel. By the time the king was brought down, the garden was soaked in luminous blood and ash. What remained beneath the garden astonished us, as it was a vault of biological treasures: ancient knowledge, botanical engineering, and stores of genetic stock from countless harvest cycles. The soil, now unbound from its ancient caretakers, was more fertile than any yet found on the planet. We may be entering a golden age of abundance.

### Event: Trial of Bravery

Evt hidden door

A single colonist was transported to a cave deep within the mountain, The Dark Immortal leading the way. A monstrous beast awaited in the darkest corner. The entity resembled a crustacean of impossible scale, its shell glittering with strange minerals and ancient alloys. It acted like it was guarding its turf, moving with an eerie coordination that hinted at a surprising level of intelligence.

**Trigger conditions:** The Dark Immortal Accepted the trial

### Event: War is the only Answer

Evt interior battle

We knew the power of the Dark Immortal was immense. Our assault was immediate and violent. The cavern trembled as the Dark Immortal let out a churning screech. While our forces took heavy damage, we managed to bind the Dark Immortal. The cavern howled, and the air cracked like splitting bone. Then the Dark Immortal was gone. Afterward, King Tamperion met the survivors. He approached the colonists and bowed deeply. For all that had been lost, the nightmare was over.

Evt hidden door

Steel met shell in the pitch-dark cavern as the chosen colonist charged into the abyss. The titanic Crustacean reacted instantly, its claws slicing through stone, its bulk shaking the mountain. But the colonist was ready. Luring it into tighter corridors, they baited the creature's movements, striking at joints and sensory nodes identified in advance. When the dust settled, the creature lay still, its final convulsion echoing through the mountain like thunder. The colonist emerged, covered in blood and dust, but alive. The Dark Immortal gave a slow nod, as if in appreciation of the colonist's reckless actions. The trial of bravery was completed.

The beast's claws were lightning-fast and hummed faintly in the cave's darkness, each movement a blur, each strike accompanied by a low-frequency pulse that set stone trembling. The colonist moved carefully, considering their options. A feint, a lure, an attempted blow, or perhaps a distraction. But the creature adapted faster than expected. Its next strikes landed true, and the cavern lit up in a burst of bioluminescent rage. When the dust cleared, the colonist lay dead. We had failed the trial.

A sound, at first trembling and uncertain, began to form within the chamber. Soon, it was as if the rocks themselves were speaking: 'I am forged in silence, not conquest or codes, A pact unspoken, that ancient grudge erodes. No engine drives me, no mind commands, Yet I steady the stars with invisible hands. Few see me come, but all feel the change A stillness where chaos once held the range.'

King Tamperion would need to return to the Court of Blossoms, not as a friend, but as a servant once more to The Dark Immortal. A broken king in a broken kingdom. Our colonists would be permitted to remain on the planet, tolerated, but never trusted again. 'You sought to free them, [founder species insult],' the Dark Immortal sounded in our heads. 'But you were not worthy.'

The colonist paused after speaking up, hoping to have presented the right answer. The chamber rumbled in approval, and the Dark Immortal seemed almost pleased. 'You understood,' came its words. 'Not all trials are of strength or power. Some require only the courage to open one's mind.' A soft light filled the room as the riddle faded away. The trial was a success, and the path forward awaits.

As the words left the colonist's mouth, the light dimmed. The Dark Immortal's voice cut through the stillness:'[founder species insult],' it said, 'not everything can be answered by the sheer lust for power.' In that instant, the colonist was struck. No weapon or flame engulfed them, just pressure and silence. They collapsed without a sound, and the chamber swallowed the body whole. We have failed the trial.

### Event: Trial of Sacrifice

Evt necrophage

A colonist stepped forward to face the trial, and was swept up to stand on a vast, darkened dais. In the center: two obsidian chairs and a long, low table. A single weapon was placed upon it, an elegant, curved blade. As the colonist picked it up with one hand, it hummed faintly with power. In one chair sat King Tamperion, bound not by rope, but by luminous cords of elemental force. His expression was unreadable, showing neither fear nor peace, only stillness. The other chair was empty. Then the voice spoke into the colonist's mind once more. 'The blade has tasted kings and cowards alike,' the Dark Immortal whispered. 'To pass this trial, one life must be taken. Take the Anathari leader's heart, or sacrifice yourself; the choice is yours. Choose wrongly... and the trial will end.'

### Event: Succeeding the Trial of Sacrifice

Evt necrophage

The colonist stood before the bound form of King Tamperion, silent, unmoving. Upon the obsidian table, the blade awaited. The Dark Immortal offered no guidance. The colonist took the blade and drove it cleanly into Tamperion's chest, swift and decisive. He made no cry. There was only a soft metallic chime, like the distant clanging of bells. King Tamperion looked up, eyes calm. The blade, buried to the hilt, had not pierced flesh, but something else entirely. His chest glowed faintly, pulsing with a golden light. King Tamperion the 'Goldenhearted' indeed... The bindings around the king dissolved and the dais faded. The Dark Immortal spoke once more into our minds: 'You may proceed.'

The colonist looked upon King Tamperion, blade in hand. King Tamperion sat still, his soft gaze offering neither plea nor permission. The colonist hesitated, then turned the blade on themself. A sharp intake of breath, and the colonist collapsed, the blade clattering against the obsidian floor. The choice was clear: to spare the Anathari leader and to carry the burden alone. But the Dark Immortal's words arrived with neither anger nor triumph: 'Compassion is not absolution. The blade was never meant for the self.' A silent tear rolled down King Tamperion's face. With the best intentions, we had sealed his people's fate. The trial ended, not in glory, but sorrow. The colonist was dead, and the path forward was sealed.

### Event: Innermost Desire

Evt treasure pile

The Dark Immortal stood before us, unchanged, unknowable. Its form was a silhouette against the stone, vast yet indistinct, as though it belonged to a reality only half-intersecting with our own. It made no sound. Instead, its presence bloomed within our minds, each thought delivered not in words but as inevitabilities. Into the stillness, the Dark immortal transmitted a thought, soft and almost pleased: 'You have gained my favor, little [founder species plural]. You have impressed me. Now speak, what is it that you desire?'

There was a pause. A silence that stretched across thought and time, but then a hushed agreement. 'The Anathari are no longer mine to watch,' the Dark Immortal spoke. 'You are bound now.' With that, it vanished. No light or sound, only a change in the air, and the sense that something vast has departed. In the cycles that followed first contact, the interspecies convergence between colonists and the Anathari intensified. Crops flourished extensively, and cities rose in harmony with the land. Flora and technology walked side by side. For the first time in centuries, [colony name] flourished, its atmosphere no longer burdened by conflict, but recalibrated for peace.

**Trigger conditions:** Innermost Desire Gained Physics

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3 months

- **Option:** **A great success.**
 - Unity Gained: 250-1000000
 - Society Research Gained: 250-100000
 - A United Future modifier added

### Event: A Rain of Golden Petals

Evt in the dark

'As you wish.' The Dark Immortal withdrew from our thoughts, and with it, something fundamental shifted. The colonists felt a deep, unsettling churning in their spines. All across the planet, the Anathari began to collapse. No scream was reported, no struggle, only the soft rustle of robes folding into dust, like petals falling in the whisper of a breeze. In the chamber, King Tamperion lingered a moment longer. His eyes blinked in utter betrayal and disappointment for the [founder species plural] species. He raised no hand, spoke no plea. A single golden bloom fell from his sleeve to the cavern floor. And then he, too, was gone. There was no mourning, nor relief. Only the absence of what once was, a people, a song, a civilization, swept from [colony name]. The Dark Immortal seemed pleased.

**Trigger conditions:** Innermost Desire Gained Society

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3 months

- **Option:** **We never needed them.**


# Stratospheric Vents

Stratospheric Vents is a small colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 years after a colony has been founded on a planet with the Stratospheric Vents modifier. It can only happen once per game.

### Event: Stratospheric Vents

Evt alien nature

Now that crucial colonization efforts of [colony name] have been completed, [empire adjective] scientists have turned their attention towards its lofty spires. These mineral formations appear to be entirely hollow, transporting gaseous substances from beneath the planet's crust all the way to the thermosphere. For an as yet unknown reason, these gases also attract Tiyanki and other spaceborne fauna to travel across great distances to this planet. A more thorough research project would allow us to study this planetary wonder and expand our understanding of these incredible creatures, or perhaps to devise a method of claiming these precious gases for ourselves.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Colony has the Stratospheric Vents modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 24 months

- **Option:** **Study the vents.**
 - Issue Special Project: Stratospheric Vents Study
- **Option:** **There is no time for this.**

### Event: Stratospheric Vents Studied

Evt alien planet

We have determined that the vents on [colony name] have formed over millions of years as superheated gas and sediments cool down and solidify. The remaining fumes in the lower thermosphere form clouds that the Tiyanki feed on, plowing through with unexpected grace. This affords us a rare opportunity not only to observe the creatures in close proximity, but also increase the colony's appeal to extraplanetary visitors. Alternatively, the vents could be harnessed for exotic gas refining at the expense of driving away the fauna from their ancient feeding grounds.

**Trigger conditions:** Stratospheric Vents

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Stratospheric Vents Study special project

- **Option:** **Use for tourism and research.**
 - Untouched Stratospheric Vents modifier added
- **Option:** **Redirect for refining.**
 - Stratospheric Vent Refineries modifier added

### Event: Stratospheric Vent Platforms

Evt tiyanki observation

The unique tourism opportunities on [colony name] could be enhanced greatly by building luxurious viewing platforms near the most active vents. This would allow visitors to get up close and personal with Tiyanki as our on-site researchers guide them through this one of a kind experience. The more affluent patrons could join scientific sampling expeditions or even experience the thrill of setting foot on a live Tiyanki!

**Trigger conditions:** Stratospheric Vents Studied Colony has the Untouched Stratospheric Vents modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 24 months

- **Option:** **Build the viewing platforms.**
 - −200
 - Untouched Stratospheric Vents modifier removed
 - Stratospheric Vent Platforms modifier added
- **Option:** **The resources are needed elsewhere.**

### Event: Stratospheric Vent Expansion

Evt undertaker

Our engineers suggest that the underground gas reserves on [colony name] could be fully harnessed by expanding the vents with mining charges. The dangers of the vents collapsing should be negligible, but the local populace should be notified just in case.

**Trigger conditions:** Stratospheric Vents Studied Colony has the Stratospheric Vent Refineries modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 24 months

- **Option:** **It is not worth the risk.**
- **Option:** **Set the charges!**
- **Option:** **The Guild will handle this.**

### Event: Vent Expansion Success

Evt mining operations

The vent expansion project was a resounding success and our engineers are reporting increased gas production across the planet. As an unfortunate side-effect, some of the more fragile vents crashed spectacularly, causing minor damage to our facilities. Despite this minor setback, we have managed to harness the unique conditions of [colony name] to great advantage.

**Trigger conditions:** Stratospheric Vent Expansion 50% chance if not Mining Guilds 75% chance if Mining Guilds

**Is triggered only by:** Chose Set the charges! or The Guild will handle this.

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Stratospheric Vent Refineries modifier removed
 - Expanded Stratospheric Vents modifier added
 - The colony gains +10 Devastation

### Event: Vent Expansion Failure

Evt night raid

Miscalculations with the mining charges caused several vents to fracture and eventually topple to the ground, resulting in considerable damage to our facilities. While some refineries are now producing more gas than before, the total yield has decreased. The silver lining is that the collapsed structures have revealed unexpected sources of minerals. These events act as a reminder that galaxy-spanning civilizations cannot be built without cracking a few vents.

**Trigger conditions:** Stratospheric Vent Expansion 50% chance if not Mining Guilds 25% chance if Mining Guilds

**Is triggered only by:** Chose Set the charges! or The Guild will handle this.

- **Option:** **Unfortunate.**
 - Stratospheric Vent Refineries modifier removed
 - Collapsed Stratospheric Vents modifier added
 - The colony gains +20 Devastation


# Subterranean Civilization

Subterranean Civilization is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 or 3 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game. The event chain offers two mutually exclusive paths which both have eventual rewards and drawbacks. The hostile path can also be followed should peace fail.

### Event: Seismic Disturbances

Evt in the dark There have been many reports of unexplainable seismic disturbances on [colony name]. Tremors can be felt across the [planet or moon], and many of our settlements have suffered damage. While investigating the earthquakes, our scientists discovered a vast network of subterranean caverns. The deepest of these caverns are home to some kind of indigenous civilization, and they appear to be tunneling towards the surface! Ground vibrations from our settlements may have triggered this behavior, but we cannot be certain. There is no telling how these aliens will react when they spill out of their tunnels and encounter our colonists!

**Trigger conditions:** Not Wilderness Not capital world Colony is not on a Ringworld, Habitat, Ecumenopolis, Relic World, Tomb World or Volcanic World

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **They'll have to fend for themselves.**
 - Relations with the subterranean civilization harmed

### Event: Subterranean Expansion

Evt in the dark We have finished clearing out the nerve gas and the dead alien bodies from the tunnel network on [colony name]. It should now be safe for our colonists to move in. The primitive cities the aliens left behind will be demolished, of course, and replaced with our own advanced architecture.

**Trigger conditions:** Finished the Preemptive Strike special project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Subterranean Cities modifier added, giving the following effects: Max Districts +3

### Event: Subterranean Refugees

Evt alien cavemen A large group of refugees from the underground alien empire on [colony name] recently streamed out of their tunnels onto the surface, chased by a small army. They are apparently part of some sort of religious minority, and claim to be fleeing persecution. If we let them join our colonists on the surface, it will no doubt anger the rulers of the empire they fled from. However, if we let the pursuing army take them back underground, they will likely face mass execution.

**Trigger conditions:** Finished the Establish Communications special project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **Let them join our colony if that is their wish.**
 - Adds 100 Pops from a random species to the colony

- **Option:** **We can't afford a political incident. Send them back.**
 - Relations with the subterranean civilization improved

### Event: Survivor Pocket

Evt underground civilization Our forces on [colony name] are still mapping the tunnel network below our colony. They have come upon a large city belonging to the subterranean aliens that managed to isolate itself from the rest of their underground empire before we flooded it with nerve gas. There are millions of frightened aliens in the city. Should our engineers collapse the cavern to finish the job?

**Trigger conditions:** Finished the Preemptive Strike special project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **Authoritarian,Xenophobe,No! Bring them to the surface, where they shall serve us.**
 - Adds 200 Pops from a random species with the Slaves citizenship species rights to the colony
- **Option:** **Yes. Put them out of their misery.**

### Event: Gift

Evt alien cavemen As a gift to celebrate the friendship between our two civilizations, a caravan from the subterranean aliens on [colony name] have brought a large quantity of gemstones to the surface. Stones such as these are apparently mined by their empire deep underground, as close to the [planet or moon]'s core as they dare to venture.

**Trigger conditions:** Finished the Establish Communications special project Relations with the subterranean civilization have been improved at least as often as they have been harmed

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **How kind.**
 - Minerals Gained: 100-1000

### Event: Gold

Evt in the dark Scout units exploring the tunnel network on [colony name] have entered the royal palace in what was once the capital city of the underground alien empire. The corpse of what passed for their emperor is still perched on a massive throne in the main chamber. After using explosive charges to breach the palace treasury, our scouts found it filled with gold and strange alien art. The art will be shipped back to museums on [capital name], and the sale of the gold should provide a nice boost to our state budget.

**Trigger conditions:** Finished the Preemptive Strike special project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Energy Credits Gained: 100-1000

### Event: Earthquakes

Evt underground civilization There has been a wave of earthquakes on [colony name] recently, and buildings in several of our settlements have collapsed with many fatalities as a result. The subterranean alien empire is excavating a new cavern deep underground where they plan to build a new city, and this appears to be the source of the earthquakes.

**Trigger conditions:** Finished the Preemptive Strike special project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **Unfortunate.**
 - The colony gets +10 Devastation

### Event: Request for Technology

Evt alien cavemen After seeing the advanced weapons that our security forces are equipped with, several generals from the subterranean alien empire on [colony name] have come forward requesting that we share some of our military technology. Our own officers are hesitant to do this, as it would make the aliens more difficult to defeat in battle should it ever come to that. If we refuse the request, however, the aliens are certain to view it as an insult.

**Trigger conditions:** Finished the Establish Communications special project

**Mean time to happen:** Time 240 months

- **Option:** **Arming savages with modern weapons would be a bad idea.**

Our security forces are responding, but we may need to send reinforcements!

**Trigger conditions:** Message Delivered

**Mean time to happen:** Time 35 days

- **Option:** **To arms!**
 - 6-12 industrial armies invade the colony

### Event: Victory

Evt ground combat Our forces have managed to drive the subterranean aliens on [colony name] back into their underground lairs, and they are contained for the moment. This is a temporary solution, however, and it is only a matter of time before they break out onto the surface again. We need to strike at them below ground, and our strategists have devised a new attack plan. It has been added to the Situation Log.

**Trigger conditions:** Subterranean Invasion!

**Is triggered only by:** Defeating the invading armies

- **Option:** **We need to solve this problem for good.**
 - Issue Special Project: Destroy Subterranean Civilization

### Event: Defeat

Evt burning settlement Our forces have been decimated on [colony name], and the subterranean aliens have taken full control over all of our settlements! They are using one of our own satellites to send a message to us.

- **Option:** **On screen.**
 - A random Fanatic Militarist and Authoritarian empire is created and takes control of the starbase and all planets in the former colony system.


# The Doorway

The Doorway is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 or 3 years after any colony has been founded. It offers either mutually exclusive paths, determined at random, or the Plight of the Beta-Universe situation.

If Overlord DLC is enabled the event can also be triggered by the Sign of the Visitor situation.

### Event: The Doorway

Evt wormhole

What can only be described as a dimensional portal has been discovered in a remote location on [colony name]. Weather prediction algorithms noticed a strange air current, which was eventually determined to be caused by the slight leakage of atmosphere into the portal. The rate of loss is far too small for it to make any difference to life on [colony name], but the very existence of this portal raises some disturbing questions, such as where does it lead to, and could something come through the portal from the other side?

**Trigger conditions:** Colony is not on a Ringworld or Habitat

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Intriguing.**
 - Adds a Portal Research Area planetary feature to the colony
 - Issue special project: Probe the Dimensional Portal on [colony name]

The special project leads to a random choice of the following events:

- “ A Dimension of Suffering ”
- “ High-Energy Dimension ”
- “ The Null Void ”
- “ Mirror Mirror ”
- “ A Dimension of Static ”

The chance of each is equal, except the last has half the probability of happening and can't happen if any of the following is true:

- the empire's homeworld is artificial (habitat, ring world, shattered ring, ecumenopolis, hive world, machine world, or relic world)
- the empire doesn't own its homeworld
- the empire has had this outcome before
- the empire isn't a player

## A Dimension of Suffering

### Event: A Dimension of Suffering

Evt space funeral

Event trigger **The below description is one of several available for this event.**

The Dimensional Portal on [colony name] seems to lead to a realm which is opposed to the sapient mind on a fundamental level. Any and all contact with material from this dimension causes intense suffering in the subject, which if continued for more than a few minutes leads to intense suicidal urges coupled with attempts to mutilate their sensory organs. Even simply studying data recorded in the strange dimension causes intense discomfort in the biological observer, and cascading errors in computer systems.

 - 40% chance: trigger event “ Dimensional Refugees ” in about 10 years
- **Option:** **Study the Portal**
 - The Dimensional Portal Area remains.
 - The Dimensional Portal can be studied on an ongoing basis.

### Event: Doorway Closed(science)

Evt news room

The Portal was determined to be able to handle almost unlimited energy input, but the key word is "almost". By generating energy at an unprecedented scale and continuously bombarding the Portal, it was eventually possible to cause it to overload and collapse in on itself. Needless to say, the generation of vast amounts of energy has the potential to be useful in other areas.

**Trigger conditions:** A Dimension of Suffering

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Close the portal! special project

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Physics research gained: 90–10 000
 - Unlocks the next tier of generator district technology
 - The Portal site can still be studied, but it will provide less useful data.

### Event: Doorway Closed(rocks)

Evt news room Sometimes a simple answer is the best answer. After blasting several mountains into gravel and dumping the result into the portal, it seems to have been overloaded. Or, perhaps, was deliberately shut down. Regardless, the remaining material was dumped on top of the site in case it ever re-opens. The experience of such a large engineering and mining project will also prove useful in other areas.

**Trigger conditions:** A Dimension of Suffering Feudal Society civic

### Event: Doorway Closed(prayer)

Evt news room

Event trigger **The below description is one of several available for this event.**

The Portal seemed to react in some way to the thoughts of nearby observers, some more than others. Through a process of elimination it was possible to find a large number of people who were especially potent at influencing the Portal, and together they were able to effectively will the Portal to close. The experience was enlightening and provides strong evidence that it is possible to harness and direct belief in tangible ways.

**Trigger conditions:** A Dimension of Suffering Spiritualist or Fanatic Spiritualist

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Close the portal! special project

## High-Energy Dimension

### Event: High-Energy Dimension

Evt star white

The Dimensional Portal on [Root.GetName] leads to a dimension of pure energy, a small amount of which can be siphoned through the portal for our own use. The procedures used to handle discrete "packets" of energy also have potential use as a weapons system.

**Trigger conditions:** The Doorway

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Probe the Dimensional Portal on [colony name] special project

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - Engineering research gained: 350–100 000
 - Gain the next level of Plasma Throwers tech as an option
 - Dimensional Portal Researcher and Dimensional Portal Drone jobs will also produce Energy

## The Null Void

### Event: The Null Void

Evt shrouded planet

The Dimensional Portal on [colony name] leads to a dimension of pure entropy. It is difficult to even get sensor readings because the very energy of our pings is rapidly dissipated. Our best theory is that this "Null Void" is a dimension where the majority of zero-point energy is negative and so any positive energy which was once present has long since been used up. Knowing this, it might be possible to construct a weapon which can use the Null Void's energy destruction offensively.

**Trigger conditions:** The Doorway

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Probe the Dimensional Portal on [colony name] special project

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - Unlocks the Null Void Beam technology with 50% progress
 - Dimensional Portal Researcher and Dimensional Portal Drone jobs will also produce 0.2 Dark Matter per 100 pops

### Event: Probing the Void

Evt wormhole

After years of study, some researchers on [colony name] are beginning to feel they understand the Null Void. There are... currents. Forces. Some flow which gently pushes against the portal to [empire name], bringing the traces of Dark Matter we are able to collect. In theory it should be possible to make our portal more "visible" to this force, which should result in a larger harvest.

**Trigger conditions:** The Null Void

**Is triggered only by:** 60-120 months after getting the The Null Void event

- **Option:** **Intriguing.**
 - Issue special project: Probe the Void

### Event: Calling the Void

Evt shrouded planet

A vast signal amplifier has sent a blast of energy through the portal on [colony name]. The effect was immediate, the pressure on the far side of the portal is noticeably stronger, and with it comes an increased flow of Dark Matter.

**Trigger conditions:** Probing the Void

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Probe the Void special project

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Dimensional Portal Researcher and Dimensional Portal Drone jobs will produce 1.2 Dark Matter per 100 pops instead of 0.2

## Mirror Mirror

### Event: Mirror Mirror

Evt senate

Strangely, the Dimensional Portal on [colony name] seems to connect to a planet which looks very much like [colony name]. Stranger still, there's a signal being broadcast to us through it...

## A Dimension of Static

### Event: A Dimension of Static

Evt news room

The Dimensional Portal on [colony name] shut itself. When we stabilized the portal, we saw that it led to a dimension consisting solely of a white, formless void interrupted only by random streaks of black noise. The strange phenomenon instantly started to seep into our universe and consumed our dimensional stabilizers, collapsing the gateway. The portal, static, and dimensional stabilizers have all winked out of existence simultaneously. Nothing was left behind; not even trace particles. If the portal hadn't been unstable, who knows what kind of disaster might have occurred here.

**Trigger conditions:** The Doorway

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Probe the Dimensional Portal on [colony name] special project

- **Option:** **Disconcerting.**

Evt wormhole

Event trigger **The below description is one of several available for this event.**

The greatest minds of the [empire name] gathered today to listen to [scientist]'s latest ideas for using the negative mass particles, only to be interrupted. Emergency sirens screeched in every observatory and space station across the system as [ homeworld name ] got a new fixture in the night sky. A rip in space the size of our star stretches over horizons while a small fleet of fighters pours through the tear.

**Trigger conditions:** Negative Mass

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1 year

# Underground Vault

Underground Vault is a colony event chain that may happen 2 or 3 years after a Tomb World has been colonized. It can only happen once per game. The event chain has entirely random outcomes.

### Event: Underground Vault

Evt underground civilization Geological surveys conducted by our colonists on [colony name] have revealed a massive vault buried deep inside a mountain range. All evidence points towards this being some kind of fallout shelter built by the same species that perished in the [planet or moon]'s ancient nuclear war. The vault has been sealed for many centuries, but our instruments have detected a faint power signature emanating from within. Our scientists are eager to open the vault and discover what lies behind its reinforced doors.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Not Gestalt Consciousness Planet was not turned into a Tomb World by orbital bombardment

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Let's crack this thing open!**
 - Issue Special Project: Open Underground Vault
- **Option:** **Best to leave that thing be.**

### Event: Special Project Completed

Evt derelict interior Our science expedition has finally managed to open the vault on [colony name], but they found nothing but ancient skeletal remains inside. It would seem that the vault's original inhabitants ran out of food approximately 200 years ago, at which point they turned on each other in some sort of cannibalistic frenzy. The scattered bones, many of them covered in gnaw marks, paint a grisly picture of the final moments that were experienced by the last survivors of this once proud civilization. On the bright side, the logs and data libraries inside the vault should be enough to keep our behavioral scientists and xeno psychologists busy for many years to come.

**Trigger conditions:** Underground Vault 33% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Open Underground Vault special project

- **Option:** **Interesting.**
 - Adds an Underground Vault planetary feature to the colony
- **Option:** **These bones will feed a people one last time.**
 - Adds an Underground Vault planetary feature to the colony
 - The Adaptive Evolution situation advances by 40
 - Mammalian DNA harvested

### Event: Special Project Completed

Evt ground combat Our scientists finally managed to open the ancient vault on [colony name], only to unleash a flood of mutated horrors - the twisted remains of the original inhabitants. The creatures slaughtered the science team in a matter of seconds, and then fanned out into the countryside. Thousands of colonists have been butchered, with entire settlements falling to the ravenous horde. We have fortified our remaining cities and established defensive perimeters, but this may not be enough!

**Trigger conditions:** Underground Vault 33% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Open Underground Vault special project

- **Option:** **Man the defenses!**
 - 3 armies invade the colony

### Event: Special Project Completed

Evt derelict interior The great vault on [colony name] has been unsealed. To the surprise of our scientists, the vast complex behind the massive vault doors housed millions of survivors from the ancient nuclear war that once ravaged this world. Despite their limited resources, they have managed to maintain a self-sufficient society for centuries. They were wary of our scientists at first, having never encountered aliens before, but also deeply grateful for our help in opening the vault. The vault contains large stores of equipment and machinery that was specifically designed for rebuilding civilization after a nuclear holocaust. It can only be operated by these aliens, but they seem more than willing to join your colonists on the surface once they have adapted to natural sunlight again.

**Trigger conditions:** Underground Vault 33% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Open Underground Vault special project

- **Option:** **Let us rebuild this world together.**
 - Adds an Underground Vault planetary feature to the colony
 - Adds 300 pops from a random species to the colony
 - If the event chain started on Earth the pops will be human
- **Option:** **Authoritarian,Xenophobe,Excellent. Prepare the slave collars!**
 - Adds an Underground Vault planetary feature to the colony
 - Adds 300 pops from a random species to the colony with the Slaves citizenship
 - If the event chain started on Earth the pops will be human
- **Option:** **Xenophobe,Send the alien scum back into the vault and bury the entrance.**

### Event: Mutants Overrun [colony name]

Evt burning settlement Our main forces on [colony name] have been decimated by the onslaught of the mutated creatures! The vile beasts are now roaming free across the entire colony, butchering our colonists with impunity. There are reports of survivors having fled the settlements to hide in the countryside, but it's only a matter of time before they are found by the marauding creatures.

**Trigger conditions:** Special Project Completed

**Is triggered only by:** Failing to defend the colony

- **Option:** **We must send military relief!**

### Event: The Liberation of [colony name]

Evt victorious army Our expeditionary forces have liberated [colony name] from the mutated horrors that were occupying our main settlements. Their rotting corpses are now littering the ground, and our troops are currently in the process of bulldozing the putrid bio-mass into hastily dug landfills. Pockets of survivors are emerging all across the [planet or moon], but many lives have been lost.

**Trigger conditions:** Mutants Overrun [colony name]

**Is triggered only by:** Liberating the overrun colony

- **Option:** **Time to rebuild.**


# Unexpected Mineral Seams

Unexpected Mineral Seams is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 2 or 3 years after any colony has been founded. It can only happen once per game. Only empires with the Subterranean origin can complete the entire event chain. Getting the event chain is necessary to unlock the Underlord achievement.

### Event: Unexpected Mineral Seams

Evt mining operations

Geological surveys on [colony name] have revealed that the planet is richer in minerals than we thought. After calibrating our sensors to penetrate deeper into the ground, we have discovered several promising mining sites. Should we direct additional resources to probing efforts, we might yet uncover deeper veins of useful ore.

**Trigger conditions:** Not capital world Original owner Not Wilderness Not Exceptional Quality Minerals planet modifier Not High Quality Minerals planet modifier Not Poor Quality Minerals planet modifier

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **No funding. Start digging.**
 - Adds an Ore-Rich Caverns planetary feature to the colony
- **Option:** **Funding Granted. Probe deeper.**
 - −1000

### Event: Deep Veins

Evt mining operations

Probing the underground of [colony name] is a tedious process: our scanners do not react well to the ground composition, and shifts in the geological layers mean that we have to recalibrate them every time. Still, we have discovered more exploitable veins of high quality ore. Their depths makes the logistics of the mining operation more complex than usual, but it will take more than that to stop us. There is no assurance that additional probing operations will lead us to more mineral veins.

**Trigger conditions:** Unexpected Mineral Seams Paid Energy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 90 days

- **Option:** **Begin mining operations.**
 - Adds the High Quality Minerals planet modifier to the colony
- **Option:** **There has to be more.**
 - −1500

### Event: Too Little, Too Deep

Evt mining operations

The latest prospecting efforts on [colony name] were inconclusive. Whatever minerals we could detect were buried too deep, in too small quantities, and through unstable ground. The projected costs of exploiting these veins would be higher than the profits. Despite this, our previous findings represents an enormous source of resources that should keep us busy for decades if not centuries.

**Trigger conditions:** Deep Veins Paid Energy Not Subterranean origin

**Mean time to happen:** Time 120 days

- **Option:** **Very well. Get to work.**
 - Adds an Ore-Rich Caverns planetary feature to the colony
 - Adds the Exceptional Quality Minerals planet modifier to the colony

### Event: More Ore

Evt in the dark

No matter how deep the minerals on [colony name] are hidden, we will find and extract them. It is what we do. Others might give up when confronted with unstable grounds, unfathomable depths or the logistics of maintining transport tunnels, but we do not. The underground is our home, and if we know where to look, it will provide. The lower we go, the higher the quality and quantity of the ore. Our latest samples even hinted at the presence of rare crystals deeper.

**Trigger conditions:** Deep Veins Paid Energy Subterranean origin

**Mean time to happen:** Time 90 days

- **Option:** **We found enough. Commence extration.**
 - Adds an Ore-Rich Caverns planetary feature to the colony
 - Adds the High Quality Minerals planet modifier to the colony
- **Option:** **These crystals shall be ours!**
 - −2000

### Event: Fiery Crystals

Evt in the dark

A new depth has been reached by our surveying expeditions on [colony name]. As predicted, we are encountering clusters of crystals that shine in vivid hues of oranges, yellows, and reds when light passes through them. At times, it looks as if a brazier is illuminating the caves where we find them, casting shifting shadows on the walls. We also made a puzzling observation: it looks as if over the millenias, these crystals are slowly migrating towards the center of the planet. We are confident that there will be more to find if only we dig deeper towards the core.

**Trigger conditions:** More Ore Paid Energy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 90 days

- **Option:** **These probing works are too expensive.**
 - Adds a Crystalline Caverns planetary feature to the colony
 - Adds the Exceptional Quality Minerals planet modifier to the colony
- **Option:** **Then a digging we shall go.**
 - −2500

### Event: The Price of Greed

Evt crystal kraken

As our surveyors delved ever deeper to find ore on [colony name], more and more crystals littered their paths. Finally, they reached a gigantic cavern located close to the core of [colony name], and we lost communications. The last thing we know is that they were in the process of setting up lights and various sensors to study the cave. Then screams. Pain. Death. Destruction. The cause was soon revealed when other geological surveyors detected multiple echoes tunneling at tremendous speed toward our colonies. Not long after, amid quakes and tremors, we were attacked by a crystalline entity of tremendous proportions. It is not unlike the spaceborne crystals, but seems to be highly aggressive, and capable of using the reconstructive capabilities of its kind to reshape its body in an instant. While the core of the crystalline entity remain buried deep, it spawned tentacle-like appendages that dug through the groud looking to attack us or to absorb more crystals to grow. Projections are grim and we might be looking at the end of our colony on [colony name].

**Trigger conditions:** Fiery Crystals Paid Energy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 90 days

- **Option:** **Battlestations!**
 - Adds an Ore-Rich Caverns planetary feature to the colony
 - Adds two Crystalline Caverns planetary features to the colony
 - Adds the Exceptional Quality Minerals planet modifier to the colony
 - An extremely powerful army invades the colony

### Event: Unusual Happenings

Evt in the dark

Our mining operations on [colony name] have encountered unexpected difficulties. Ranging from mild tremors to shifting crystal veins, something is going on. Despite all our experience in tunnneling, we have no idea what it is. These circumstances make it hard to work in secure conditions, and we have already lost gear, lives and ore in unpredictable accidents and collapses. Perhaps it would be best to halt mining operations under a certain depth?

**Trigger conditions:** Fiery Crystals Did not pay Energy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 3000 days

- **Option:** **Safety first.**
 - Removes a Crystalline Caverns planetary feature from the colony
 - Removes the Exceptional Quality Minerals planet modifier from the colony
- **Option:** **It's probably nothing.**

### Event: The Price of Greed

Evt crystal kraken

As our surveyors delved ever deeper to find ore on [colony name], more and more crystals littered their paths. Finally, they reached a gigantic cavern located close to the core of [colony name], and we lost communications. The last thing we know is that they were in the process of setting up lights and various sensors to study the cave. Then screams. Pain. Death. Destruction. The cause was soon revealed when other geological surveyors detected multiple echoes tunneling at tremendous speed toward our colonies.

Projections are grim and we might be looking at the end of our colony on [colony name].

**Trigger conditions:** Unusual Happenings Did not remove the event bonuses

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1000 days

- **Option:** **Battlestations!**
 - An extremely powerful army invades the colony

### Event: Crystalline Entity Defeated

Evt victorious army

After a grueling campaign, the crystalline entity dwelling at the heart of a planet has finally been defeated. The final battle took place deep underground, in the cave housing the core of the crystal behemoth, and only after we managed to shatter it did the beast stop fighting. Its various appendages disintegrated, losing cohesion at a molecular level and sprinkling crystal dust across the planet. The innumerable tunnels left in the wake of crystal tentacles are going to help us a lot in our efforts to mine the exceptionnally rich minerals composing this world. As for the origin of the entity itself, we are left with many questions, but we might have just gained some insight on the way that spacefaring crystalline entities are created.

**Trigger conditions:** The Price of Greed

**Is triggered only by:** Defeating the invading army

- **Option:** **Victory at last.**
 - Adds a Crystalline Remains planetary features to the colony
 - Unity Gained: 240-99999
 - On ironman mode it unlocks the Underlord achievement

# Imminent Eruption

Imminent Eruption is a colony event chain that has a very small chance to trigger 1 year after any colony has been founded in a Volcanic World. It can only happen once per game.

## Initial event

### Event: Imminent Eruption

Evt inf imminent eruption

Geological alert systems warn that a volcanic eruption near the main settlement on [colony name] is likely to occur within the next year. Investing in a controlled pressure release could allow the lava flow to be harnessed for energy production. Crews could also be put on standby to harvest magma directly from the eruption and strain it for precious metals. Alternatively, we could focus on evacuating civilians and supplies from the area to minimize risk. We can also continue to monitor the situation before committing to any action, in case the predictions are inaccurate.

**Trigger conditions:** Volcanic World

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1 year

- **Option:** **Evacuate!**
 - −500
- **Option:** **Wait and see.**
- **Option:** **Focus on power generation.**
- **Option:** **Harvest the magma.**

## Outcomes

Depending on the selected option, one of the following outcomes will happen:

### Event: Just in time

Evt burning settlement

The early evacuation of the colony turned out to be a good choice. The volcano erupted sooner than expected, severely damaging the buildings in the area. Now that the underground volcanic pressure is minimal, the colonists can return and safely rebuild.

**Trigger conditions:** Chose Evacuate!

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 days

- **Option:** **Excellent.**

### Event: Enhanced Power-Grid

Evt generator powerup

Engineering crews were able to establish a safe system for slowly releasing pressurized lava from the underground chambers, passing it through power generators as it went. This has resulted in a short-term boon to the colony's electrical grid.

**Trigger conditions:** Chose Focus on power generation.

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 days

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Energy Gained: 250-5000

### Event: Magma Harvesting

Evt mining operations

The volcanic eruption was interrupted by a combination of ultrasonic disruptors and physical barriers, resulting in a large field of magma contained and hardening on the surface. Mining crews have already begun harvesting this mineral bounty.

**Trigger conditions:** Chose Harvest the magma.

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 days

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Minerals Gained: 350-10000

### Event: Volcanic Wrath

Evt inf cataclysmic eruption

The volcano exploded early, and the colony was not prepared to deal with the catastrophe. Massive damage occurred to infrastructure, and loss of life was significant.

**Trigger conditions:** Chose Wait and see. 50% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 days

- **Option:** **Unfortunate.**
 - 200 Pops die

### Event: Wait and See

Evt molten planet

After a few months, volcanic activity near the [colony name] colony has subsided again. While the long-term safety risk has not disappeared, it appears the colony is safe for the time being.

**Trigger conditions:** Chose Wait and see. 50% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5 days

- **Option:** **The risks paid off.**
 - Unity Gained: 150-100000

## Anomaly event chains


# Drifting Battlefield

Drifting Battlefield is an anomaly event chain triggered by investigating the Rubiconian Shores anomaly that can appear on habitable planets. The conclusion of the event chain might grant the empire control of a small alien fleet.

### Event: Of Transmissions Past

Evt alien ruins

As expected, the [science ship name] has located the source of the transmission emanating from [anomaly planet name]. While the planet is otherwise seemingly untouched by alien hands, a lone monolith of some sleek off-white mineral stands atop a hill in the southern hemisphere. It is from within this monument that the signal emerges, the enclosure clearly built for longevity rather than resonance. Science Officer [science ship scientist] has gone out of their way to establish the parameters for a Special Project that would decode the information the signal carries.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** Investigating the Rubiconian Shores anomaly

- **Option:** **An appropriate initiative.**
 - Issue Special Project: Monumental Transmission
- **Option:** **We have little to gain by listening to the dead.**
 - Influence Gained: 40-100
- **Option:** **Raze the monument, find the transmitter.**

### Event: Of Transmissions Crushed

Evt alien ruins

We believed the monolith to be only a protective housing for the transmitter, but we were wrong. The transmitter, once isolated, turned out to be useless on its own. Something about the internal structure of the now-razed monolith made it work, and we have no hope of restoring its function.

**Trigger conditions:** Of Transmissions Past Razed the monument 50% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Previous event choice

- **Option:** **Disappointing.**

### Event: Of Transmissions Decoded

Evt alien ruins

Science Officer [science ship scientist] reports that the signal broadcast by the transmission beacon on [anomaly planet name] has been decoded. It is a memorial message, decrying the loss of hundreds of lives in a battle millennia past. A stalwart alliance apparently fell victim to treachery and deceit, and a massive fleet wiped itself out before the enemy had even arrived, as ally turned on ally. Apparently these desiccated hulks were left in place as floating grave-markers, the crews having been destroyed by surgical strikes to weak points in their ships' hulls.

**Trigger conditions:** Of Transmissions Past

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Monumental Transmission special project

- **Option:** **Study these records.**
 - Add +8 Engineering Research to the anomaly planet
- **Option:** **Calculate the wrecked fleet's trajectory and current position.**
 - Point of interest: Drifting Battlefield

### Event: Of Transmissions Crushed

Evt alien ruins

The monolith disassembles with surprising ease. Contrary to earlier assumptions, the tiny transmitter at its center energizes the mineral structure of the monolith, enabling the transmission.

**Trigger conditions:** Of Transmissions Past Razed the monument 50% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Previous event choice

- **Option:** **Interesting.**
 - Research option gained: Xenology
- **Option:** **Interesting.**
 - Research option gained: Doctrine: Reactive Formations

### Event: Of Pirates Current

Evt ruined system

Upon arriving in the [current system name] system, it becomes clear that the [science ship name] is too late. A pirate fleet of unknown origin discovered the straying battlefield some time ago, and cannibalized it to build a base on a nearby asteroid. Our search ends, as a violent confrontation seems unavoidable.

**Trigger conditions:** Of Transmissions Decoded 40% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the point of interest system

- **Option:** **Battlestations!**
 - A pirate station and a fleet of 6 corvettes and 2 destroyers appear in the system

### Event: Of Fleets Drifting

Evt ruined system

The [science ship name] has located the drifting wrecks in the [current system name] system. Many of the ships referenced in the memorial beacon message have been reduced to dust and ashes over the centuries, but a few still remain remarkably intact. Between them, six military vessels should have enough engineers to restore the better-preserved hulks to working order. Consult the Situation Log for details.

**Trigger conditions:** Of Transmissions Decoded 60% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the point of interest system

- **Option:** **Most intriguing.**
 - Issue Special Project: Ancient Alliance Armada

### Event: Of Fleets Commandeered

Evt federation fleet

The ancient rag-tag armada has been partially resurrected, although the dispatched engineers cannot agree on exactly how this feat was accomplished. The vessels have been commissioned into the [founder species adjective] fleets.

**Trigger conditions:** Of Fleets Drifting

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Ancient Alliance Armada special project

- **Option:** **OK**
 - Gain a fleet of 1 alien corvette, 2 alien destroyers and 3 alien cruisers


# Gas Giant Signal

Gas Giant Signal is an anomaly event chain triggered by investigating the anomaly of the same name that can appear on gas giants. The event chain contains numerous special projects, each one requiring a science ship to orbit a targeted gas giant and taking 180 days to complete.

### Event: Gas Giant Signal

Evt atmospheric flight

The [science ship name] has picked up some curious readings from [anomaly gas giant name]. There are significant pockets of radiation in the gas giant's atmosphere that appear to be the result of intense orbital bombardment. What someone could hope to gain by bombing a gas giant from orbit remains a mystery however. As the [science ship name] was preparing to break orbit, Science Officer [science ship scientist name] discovered a weak signal coming from the planet's interior. It may be a transmission of some kind, but the gas giant's background radiation makes it difficult to isolate.

Evt microscopic life The small fungoid has recently begun to vocalize! Its first words were a guttural "nivlac." Incoherent, but ardently repeated. And so the scientists have proudly named the fungoid Nivlac . Since then its language has developed at a spectacular rate and it's now able to successfully convey the seven primary emotions - and does so often to its own spawn. It reproduces - by spreading its spores - as a matter of routine, and the laboratory will soon be insufficient to house the fungoids. The Nivlac still has not shown any signs of aggression.

# Limbo

Limbos is an anomaly event chain triggered by investigating the On the Barren Plains anomaly that can appear on barren worlds. The event chain has the potential of creating another empire on the galactic stage upon its conclusion.

### Event: Limbo

Evt landing ship 2

The signal originates from the remains of an antenna-like structure. Exploratory probes were dispatched from the [science ship name] to the surface to investigate the matter more closely. What Science Officer [science ship scientist] found was a cavernous vault that, while easily pried open, was evidently the last safehouse and refuge of some long-dead race of aliens. While reasonably technologically advanced, it seems they never reached for the stars and perished to some planet-wide natural disaster. The vault is immense, housing thousands upon thousands of black boxes that the [science ship name] has determined to be data storage devices. A Special Project has been prepared to decode their contents.

The options to modify the founder species are not available to empires with the Natural Design or Innate Design civic.

### Event: Orbital Speed Demon

Evt ship in orbit

Attempts to scan the object in high-speed orbit of [anomaly asteroid name] have been unsuccessful. The object quickly falls below [anomaly asteroid name]'s horizon and the [science ship name]'s instruments are simply unable to keep up. While [anomaly asteroid name]'s gravitational pull is strong, that alone does little to explain the object's extreme momentum. Either the object itself possesses some extraordinary properties, or there is some gravitational phenomenon at work here. The object's velocity appears to be increasing over time, and Science Officer [science ship scientist] suspects that it may soon be thrown out of orbit, even without outside interference.

OLD SCREENSHOTS:

### Event: Familiar Shrine

Evt asteroid approaching planet Most of the asteroid has been laser-chiseled, with great precision, into the likeness of a small [main species name] temple, or large shrine. A shrine to the Untold, the great destroyer-deity of old [main species adjective] faiths. The temple has been tumbling through the quiet of space for far longer than we have been capable of space-flight, which is... disturbing, at best. Terrifying at worst. Naturally, Science Officer [science ship scientist] urges us to search for more stellar objects that match the characteristics of this space-temple, and has uploaded a list of likely candidates in nearby systems to the Situation Log.

### Event: Old Gods: Shrine to the Benefactress

Evt mining station Deciphering the pictograms in the Benefactress' shrine was a much smoother process than anticipated. All linguists involved describe the language quickly "connecting" or "clicking" in their minds, despite its age and complexity. However, the writings are unlikely to make much sense until they are combined with the other writs associated with the rest of the quadrumvirate godhead.

### Event: Old Gods: Shrine to the Percipient

Evt mining station Science Officer [science ship scientist] has reported back with the [science ship name]'s findings at the Percipient's shrine. They recognized early on that a text in some logographic script is inlaid in the walls, heavily distorted by the layers of translucent lacquer. Initial attempts at unscrambling the text, relying on the raw processing power of the [science ship name]'s computers to reconstruct the text from plain images, proved fruitless as it was simply too distorted to place in any known lingual family tree. Next, the crew of the [science ship name] attempted bombarding the lacquer with light of varying wavelengths and intensity, but no beneficial reactions were observed. [science ship scientist] apparently considered physically separating the lacquer from the inlaid text, but realized that the strange glyphs would doubtlessly have been made misshapen to begin with, only to assume their proper shape when viewed correctly through the lens of the lacquer. Science Officer [science ship scientist] was about to call the mission a failure when, looking up as they irritably paced along the edges of the circular space, they realized that discrete lines of cohesive text were momentarily forming before their eyes, melting away only to be replaced by new lines. Not long after they had the ceiling, walls and floor imaged in a spiral pattern. Texts from other shrines should help us piece it all together.

### Event: Old Gods: Revelation

Evt metropolis The complete doctrine of the gods - for that is what the recovered texts have to be regarded as, dwarfing the fairy-tale scraps upon which the old [main species name] religions were founded - is as shockingly revelatory as it is revolutionary. With only a little bit of creative interpretation, it is clear that the people of [capital name] were meant for great things, guided by the strong hand of a religious leader. Our path is one to godhood, but our past is littered with prophecies unfulfilled and sin born of ignorance. Redemption is ephemeral.

# The Ransomeers

The Ransomeers is an anomaly event chain triggered by investigating the Doppler Effect anomaly that can appear on uninhabitable planets. The conclusion and effects of the event chain depend on whether the objective is accomplished by the player empire or by another empire.

### Event: The Ransomeers: Emergency Buoy

Evt satellite in orbit

An emergency transmission buoy floats in gentle orbit around [planet name]. Its outer casing is heavily damaged, seemingly by glancing weapons fire or a powerful explosion. It might be a [founder species adjective] model for civilian ships - designed to be ejected as an emergency measure should the comms systems fail - but the extent of the damage makes it impossible to know for certain. It is repeating a weak, distorted signal.

**Trigger conditions:** Not Gestalt Consciousness Encountered space pirates

**Is triggered only by:** Investigating the Doppler Effect anomaly

- **Option:** **Clean up the transmission.**
 - Issue Special Project: Emergency Buoy
- **Option:** **It could be a trap - best leave it be.**

### Event: The Ransomeers: SOS

Evt satellite in orbit

The buoy has been verified as one of [founder species adjective] make, and the signal it's relaying has been stabilized.

**Trigger conditions:** The Ransomeers: Emergency Buoy

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Emergency Buoy special project

- **Option:** **[founder species adjective] authorities. Identify yourselves.**
 - A pirate station and a fleet of 5 corvettes appear in a a system 1-6 hyperlanes away. That system is added as point of interest in the Situation Log.
- **Option:** **Shut it down. No one is to speak of this.**
 - −50

### Event: The Ransomeers: Best Laid Plans

Evt pirates attacking cargo

The pirate base, while fairly inconspicuous, is obvious when you know what to look for. A fleet in confused formation slowly drifts out from behind the re-purposed mining complex - they were obviously not expecting company.

**Trigger conditions:** The Ransomeers: SOS

**Is triggered only by:** Entering the point of interest system

- **Option:** **Open comms. The captives need to be ready.**

### Event: The Ransomeers: Picking Up The Pieces

Evt large explosion

As the pirate base slowly tears itself apart in a savage chain reaction instigated by our military vessels, the search for the captive crew of the Luxion begins. If they made it to a lifeboat, they should be attempting to hail us by now...

**Trigger conditions:** The Ransomeers: Best Laid Plans

**Is triggered only by:** Destroying the pirate station

- **Option:** **Scan all frequencies.**

### Event: The Ransomeers: All's Well?

Evt pirate armada

With the crew of the Luxion safely on their way back to [empire capital name], disaster has been averted. The [empire adjective] people are sure to glory in the decisive actions of the [empire name]'s [ruler title]. The situation with the kidnapping Ransomeer pirates, as well as the pirate band itself, has come to an end. Some questions remain, mainly relating to the much larger piratical navy the captives claim to have seen through portholes shortly after their capture. But, considering the circumstances, it can safely be assumed that the threat appeared to be much greater than it actually was. The Ransomeers are over and done with.

**Trigger conditions:** The Ransomeers: Picking Up The Pieces 50% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Closing the previous event

 - Savior modifier added for 120 months, giving the following effects: Happiness +10%

### Event: The Ransomeers: Smoke and Ashes

Evt large explosion

The kidnapped [founder species adjective] never made it off the pirate base. We are unable to determine exactly where they met their end - if the lifeboat failed to launch, or if they never made it out of their holding cell - but fact remains that they are dead. The [founder species adjective] people are sure to appreciate the swift actions undertaken by the [ruler title] of the [empire name], but they are also unlikely to soon forget this tragedy.

**Trigger conditions:** The Ransomeers: Picking Up The Pieces 50% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Closing the previous event

**Trigger conditions:** The Ransomeers: SOS 50% chance

**Is triggered only by:** A known empire destroys the pirate station

- **Option:** **We will never forget this tragedy.**
 - The empire gains a permanent −10 opinion towards the empire that destroyed the pirate station

# 42 Years and 3 Days

42 Years and 3 Days is an anomaly event chain triggered by investigating the Debris Field anomaly that can appear on habitable worlds. It can only happen once per game. The outcome is selected when the initial event occurs.

## Initial event

### Event: 42 Years and 3 Days

Evt clocks

A closer scan of the debris field around [anomaly planet name] has led to the discovery of an airtight capsule containing an atomic clock that measures time with unparalleled precision. It has a frequency uncertainty so low that it will be another 879 million years before it gains a single second and it is counting down to a date 42 years and 3 days away. The capsule holds no clues as to what this date signifies or who the owners are. But it seems as though someone out there has lost track of the time...

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** Investigating the Debris Field anomaly

- **Option:** **Keep an eye on it.**
 - Gain 18x Engineering output ( 350~100 000 )
- **Option:** **IT'S A BOMB!! DESTROY IT!!**
 - Gain 18x Engineering output ( 350~100 000 )

## Outcomes

If the first option was chosen then once precisely 42 years and 3 days pass since the initial event happens, one of the following outcomes, with each having even odds of happening if they can happen, will take place:

### Event: Atomic Countdown

Evt clocks

Researchers on [capital name] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [anomaly planet name] for the past 42 years and 3 days. Several decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, ejecting a stream of self-replicating nanites! These nanites are streaming on a trajectory towards another planet in the [system name] System, [uninhabitable planet name], projected to arrive within the month. Whatever may happen once they arrive remains to be seen...

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** 42 years and 3 days pass

 - Gain 6x Influence output ( 40~100 )
 - A random planet becomes a Nanite World with a deposit of 4 Engineering Research
 - If Grand Archive is enabled it also gives the Peerless Atomic Clock specimen

### Event: Atomic Countdown

Evt mining station

Researchers on [capital name] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [anomaly planet name] for the past 42 years and 3 days. Several decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, ejecting a stream of self-replicating nanites! These nanites left the surface of the asteroid, where they have coalesced into a fascinating, unmanned military vessel. It is ours for the taking, should we so desire.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** 42 years and 3 days pass

- **Option:** **Incredible.**
 - A nanite cruiser is gained
 - If an L-Gate was discovered the empire gains an L-Gate Insight
 - If Grand Archive is enabled it also gives the Peerless Atomic Clock specimen
- **Option:** **Scrap it for materials.**
 - Gain 1500 alloys
 - If an L-Gate was discovered the empire gains an L-Gate Insight

### Event: Atomic Countdown

Evt ancient alien temple

Researchers on [capital name] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [anomaly planet name] for the past 42 years and 3 days. Several decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, ejecting a stream of self-replicating nanites! The nanites have constructed some manner of advanced computational network on the surface of [celestial object name]. The network is inactive, and seemingly devoid of any AI, the nanites having deactivated the instant its construction was complete. Our researchers are somewhat baffled as to the purpose of the network. Studying it should keep them occupied for quite some time.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Is triggered only by:** 42 years and 3 days pass

- **Option:** **Incredible.**
 - A celestial object in a random system gains a Research Station and a deposit of 10 Engineering Research
 - If Grand Archive is enabled it also gives the Peerless Atomic Clock specimen

### Event: Atomic Countdown

Evt exploding planet

For the past 42 years and 3 days, researchers on [capital name] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision, found on [anomaly planet name]. Now several decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant, along with most of [primitive planet name]. As the clock reached its momentous deadline it transmitted a signal to a receiver on [primitive planet name], triggering a thermonuclear explosion of such devastating power it laid waste to the entire planet and the primitive society residing there. While our scientists debate the reason behind this carefully timed act of annihilation, the atomic clock continues to tick, undisturbed by the desolation below.

# Lost Amoeba

Lost Amoeba is an anomaly event chain triggered by investigating the Movement in the Clouds anomaly that can appear on gas giants. Getting the event chain is necessary to unlock the It Followed Me Home achievement.

### Event: Lost Amoeba

Evt friendly amoeba

The [science ship name] has located the source of the movement in the upper atmosphere of [gas giant name]. Surprisingly, there was no ship hidden in the clouds, but rather a young Space Amoeba, its mother nowhere to be seen. There is no way of knowing how this juvenile was separated from its mother or others of its kind, but one thing is certain: it appears to have imprinted on the [science ship name]. As the crew completed their survey of [gas giant name], they found that the Amoeba was following them. It has proven difficult to shake, and [science ship scientist] has taken quite a shine to the youngster's determination. Our Science Officer suggests allowing the juvenile to follow the vessel, certain we may learn more about Space Amoebas in the process.

**Trigger conditions:** Distant Stars DLC

**Is triggered only by:** Investigating the Movement in the Clouds anomaly

- **Option:** **NoVery well...**

### Event: Lost Juvenile Amoeba

Evt star chart

Researchers report that the lost Amoeba juvenile found near [gas giant name] is no longer following our science fleet. After doing so for the past several weeks, the juvenile reportedly entered a hyperlane via some biological hyperdrive capacity. Perhaps it recognized the terrain, or sensed others of its kind. Or perhaps it simply tired of chasing after our ship. Though our ships refrained from interacting with the juvenile as instructed, passive scans have led to some revelations regarding the creature's physiology.

**Trigger conditions:** The Space Amoeba Juvenile follows the science ship

Evt friendly amoeba

The Amoeba juvenile that joined our fleet some time ago appears to have reached full maturity. Now an impressive adult, she is no less loyal to the ships that gave her a new home when she was stranded on [gas giant name]. Her time spent with the fleet appears to have encouraged adaptive behaviors not typically found in wild Space Amoebas, making her a more formidable presence on the battlefield than others of her kind. Across [empire name], her image has become something of a mascot for the [empire adjective] spirit. Only one question remains: what should we name her?

## Pre-FTL event chains


# Anti-Alien Task Force

Anti-Alien Task Force is a pre-FTL civilization event chain that can trigger if an Observation Post is conducting Aggressive Observation. It can only happen once per game. Once the event chain starts dismantling the Observation Post or revealing the empire's presence will no longer be possible until the event chain ends one way or another.

### Event: Anti-Alien Task Force

Evt senate

In an apparent response to our operations on their primitive world, many of the [pre-FTL species name] nation states on [pre-FTL world name] have momentarily put aside their squabbling to form a new supranational military organization. According to local media, this task force has been charged with defending their [planet or moon] from "hostile activities perpetrated by an unknown alien agency against the [pre-FTL species name] species as a whole."

**Trigger conditions:** Pre-FTL civilization reached at least Machine Age Awareness is Partially Aware or higher

**Mean time to happen:** Time 720 months

- **Option:** **Disconcerting.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization gains 20 Awareness if Partially Aware
 - Pre-FTL civilization gains 10 Awareness if High Awareness

### Event: Task Force Activities

Evt colony settlement

Reconnaissance footage taken by our Observation Post above [pre-FTL world name] has confirmed the construction of several new military bases and radar facilities on the [planet or moon]'s surface, all under the control of the supranational anti-alien task force recently founded by the [pre-FTL species plural]. We are seeing an unprecedented level of cooperation between their nation states, and our abduction flights are now being routinely intercepted by atmospheric fighters belonging to this force. Despite our technological edge, their sheer numbers have enabled them to bring down several of our abduction shuttles!

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Anti-Alien Task Force

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **This will impair our aggressive observation activities.**

### Event: Observation Post Lost

Evt exploding ship

Our Observation Post above [pre-FTL world name] has been destroyed! The culprit was a large surface-to-space missile launched from a military base controlled by the [pre-FTL species name] supranational task force. We are still not certain how they managed to track the station, since extensive precautions had been taken to conceal its existence from the [pre-FTL species plural]. One theory is that the natives have managed to reverse-engineer technologies looted from our downed shuttles.

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Task Force Activities 33% chance if the observation post is not cloaked 3% chance if the observation post is cloaked

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **This is outrageous!**
 - The Observation Post is destroyed
 - Pre-FTL civilization makes 10% progress towards the next age

### Event: Surgical Strike

Evt hangar bay

The staff of our Observation Post orbiting [pre-FTL world name] has requested help in dealing with the anti-alien task force that was founded by the [pre-FTL species plural] in response to our aggressive observation efforts. Though primitive by our standards, this organization has developed a knack for disrupting our abduction operations. Their main base has been identified on the [planet or moon]'s surface, deep inside a mountain. Orbital bombardment will be ineffective, but a swift raid by a heavily armed strike team should be able to take the base by surprise. Its destruction will surely spell the end of this irksome [pre-FTL species name] task force.

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Task Force Activities 33% chance if the observation post is not cloaked 48.5% chance if the observation post is cloaked

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Make it happen.**
 - Issue Special Project: Destroy Primitive Defense Force
- **Option:** **No, we should avoid antagonizing them further...**

### Event: Task Force Disbanded

Evt senate

The supranational task force that the [pre-FTL species name] nation states founded to thwart our operations on [pre-FTL world name] has been disbanded! Though they somehow managed to achieve several victories against our shuttles and abduction teams, several of the organization's founding members decided to cut off funding and withdraw from the project. Intelligence puts this unexpected turn of events down to infighting and diplomatic posturing between the [pre-FTL species name] nation states.

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Task Force Activities 33% chance if the observation post is not cloaked 48.5% chance if the observation post is cloaked

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **A welcome, if unexpected, development.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization loses 10 Awareness

### Event: Successful Strike

Evt burning settlement

Our mission to destroy the main base of the [pre-FTL species name] supranational task force was a complete success! The base was infiltrated by our strike team, and its defenders and their primitive weapons proved no match for our skilled operatives. After planting explosive charges deep within the bowels of the base, the strike team exfiltrated and were picked up by waiting shuttles. Nothing remains of this troublesome [pre-FTL species name] task force now.

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Surgical Strike 70% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Destroy Primitive Defense Force special project

- **Option:** **Mission successful.**

### Event: Failed Strike

Evt ground combat

Our mission to destroy the main base of the [pre-FTL species name] supranational task force failed miserably! Several of the shuttles carrying our strike team were brought down by hidden anti-aircraft emplacements before they even made it to the base. The remaining operatives met with unexpectedly stiff resistance when they eventually reached the base entrance. In light of approaching [pre-FTL species name] reinforcements, the strike team commander finally gave the order to retreat. Unfortunately, as our exfiltration shuttles were blasting their way into orbit, a massive formation of atmospheric fighters intercepted them. Losses were heavy.

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Surgical Strike 30% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Destroy Primitive Defense Force special project

- **Option:** **This is a disaster!**
 - Pre-FTL civilization gains 10 Awareness


# Missing Scientist

Missing Scientist is a pre-FTL civilization event chain that can trigger if an Observation Post is conducting Passive Observation on a pre-Industrial Age civilization. It can happen multiple times per game. Once the event chain starts dismantling the Observation Post or revealing the empire's presence will no longer be possible until the event chain ends one way or another.

### Event: Missing Scientist

Evt landing ship

One of the scientists working at the Observation Post orbiting [pre-FTL world name] has been reported missing. [he or she] was taking part in a covert mission to collect plant samples from the [planet or moon]'s surface, but did not return to the shuttle with the rest of his team. We have been conducting a limited search so as not to alert the natives, but so far without success.

**Trigger conditions:** Not Gestalt Consciousness Pre-FTL Civilization did not reach Industrial Age

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5000 months

- **Option:** **Keep up the search.**

### Event: Scientist Found Dead

Evt alien nature

We have finally recovered the body of the missing scientist on [pre-FTL world name]... or what remained of it, at any rate. It looks like [he or she] fell victim to a large indigenous predator. An unfortunate loss to our science team, but at least the locals are still oblivious to our presence.

**Trigger conditions:** Missing Scientist 25% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 10 days

- **Option:** **The Directive has been upheld.**
 - Loss of Personnel modifier added for 12 months, giving the following effects: Society from Jobs −10%

### Event: Strange Reports from [pre-FTL world name]

Evt primitive civilization

We are receiving strange reports from our observers above [pre-FTL world name]. One of the native kingdoms has rallied under a mysterious religious figure, and we have seen evidence of them using advanced technology far beyond their current level of development. Could this be related to our missing scientist?

**Trigger conditions:** Missing Scientist 75% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Curious.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization gains 20 Awareness if Partially Aware
 - Pre-FTL civilization advances to Industrial Age
 - If the Non-interference Act resolution has been passed the empire will be in breach of galactic law for 10 years

### Event: Rogue Scientist Consolidates Power

Evt enlightenment failure

We have received alarming reports from the surface of [pre-FTL world name]. It looks like our rogue scientist is consolidating power - [he or she] has given one of the feudal kingdoms access to advanced weaponry, and they are now in the process of conquering the rest of the [planet or moon] in [his or her] name. A plan has been put forward to remove [him or her] from power, but it will require significant ground forces. There is no telling what effect this will have on the native population, as many have come to see [him or her] as a god.

**Trigger conditions:** Strange Reports from [pre-FTL world name]

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 months

- **Option:** **The operation is a go. Remove [him or her].**
 - Pre-FTL civilization becomes Fully Aware
 - Pre-FTL civilization advances to Machine Age
 - Issue Special Project: Extract Missing Scientist
- **Option:** **It would only make things worse...**
 - Pre-FTL civilization becomes Fully Aware
 - Pre-FTL civilization advances to Machine Age

### Event: Successful Extraction

Evt burning settlement

We have successfully extracted the rogue scientist from [pre-FTL world name]! Hundreds of natives were tragically gunned down when they launched suicidal attacks against our forces in a futile attempt to protect their "god." Our legal system will now deal with the scientist, but the impact of these events on the [planet or moon]'s civilization must be immense. They still possess some of our technology, and their deity has just been spirited away by invaders from the stars.

**Trigger conditions:** Rogue Scientist Consolidated Power

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Extract Rogue Scientist special project

- **Option:** **At least one problem has been dealt with.**

### Event: Missile Strikes Observation Post!

Evt exploding ship

A barrage of surface-to-space missiles have been launched from the surface of [pre-FTL world name] at our observation post in high orbit! The station was destroyed with no survivors. It looks like the primitive civilization on the [planet or moon]'s surface has advanced at an incredible rate - no doubt thanks to the efforts of our rogue scientist. They can no longer be considered primitive, and the window of opportunity to remove the scientist from power has been closed.

**Trigger conditions:** Rogue Scientist Consolidated Power

**Is triggered only by:** The Extract Rogue Scientist special project expires

- **Option:** **Disconcerting.**
 - The Observation Post is destroyed

### Event: Situation Calms on [pre-FTL world name]

Evt primitive civilization

The situation on [pre-FTL world name] seems to have settled down a bit since the successful extraction of our rogue scientist. Without [him or her] to interpret the data, the technical schematics [he or she] brought with [him or her] are of no use to them. They have started reverting back to their old ways.

**Trigger conditions:** Successful Extraction 33% chance if the Pre-FTL civilization does not have the Mechanist origin 50% chance if the Pre-FTL civilization has the Mechanist origin

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Some good news at last.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization regresses to Steam Age or Renaissance Age

### Event: Impending Doom on [pre-FTL world name]

Evt alien abduction

Having witnessed the apparent rapture of their savior, the inhabitants of [pre-FTL world name] are not in a good place. Society is splintering, and tensions have risen to untenable levels. If we do not take action, they will use our technology to tear themselves apart in a planet-wide religious war.

**Trigger conditions:** Successful Extraction Pre-FTL civilization does not have the Mechanist origin 33% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Retrieve our technology.**
 - If the Non-interference Act resolution has been passed the empire will be in breach of galactic law for 10 years
- **Option:** **We must not risk further cultural contamination.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization shifts ethics towards Fanatic Spiritualist

### Event: Missile Strikes Observation Post!

Evt exploding ship

A barrage of surface-to-space missiles have been launched from the surface of [pre-FTL world name] at our Observation Post! The station was destroyed with no survivors. It looks like the primitive civilization on the [planet or moon]'s surface is continuing to advance at an incredible rate - despite the fact that we removed the influence of their so-called "god." The technology [he or she] gave them must have triggered a lasting scientific revolution.

**Trigger conditions:** Successful Extraction 33% chance if the Pre-FTL civilization does not have the Mechanist origin 50% chance if the Pre-FTL civilization has the Mechanist origin

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **This is why we have a directive of noninterference.**
 - The Observation Post is destroyed
 - Pre-FTL civilization advances to Early Space Age

### Event: Religious Conflicts on [pre-FTL world name]

Evt city ruins

[pre-FTL world name] has descended into a massive war following the successful extraction of our rogue scientist. The empire [he or she] built has fragmented into several quarreling factions, each with their own interpretation of his religious dogma. Fighting has been particularly fierce due to the destructive weaponry the natives are now using. Several radiological "dirty bombs" have so far been detonated by the opposing factions, and it looks like the conflict is only getting started.

**Trigger conditions:** Impending Doom on [pre-FTL world name] Fanatic Spiritualist pre-FTL civilization

**Mean time to happen:** Time 100 days

- **Option:** **This will not end well...**
 - A nuclear war will start in 1 or 2 years


# Rogue Agent

Rogue Agent is a pre-FTL civilization event chain that can trigger if an Envoy is assigned to a Spy Network on a pre-FTL civilization. It can only happen once per game.

### Event: Rogue Agent

Evt infiltration neutral

One of our covert operatives on [pre-FTL world name] has gone rogue! The poor, misguided fool has apparently been smitten by a [pre-FTL species name] female, and the two of them have eloped to parts unknown on the [planet or moon]'s surface. We are as yet uncertain whether our agent has revealed his true alien nature to his love interest or if he is still posing as a [pre-FTL species name] to her. Needless to say this is a tremendous security breach - we should do everything in our power to bring this agent back and give him the psychiatric care he is so clearly in need of.

**Trigger conditions:** Not Gestalt Consciousness Not Subtle Interference Pre-FTL Interference policy Pre-FTL Civilization did not reach Industrial Age

**Mean time to happen:** Time 83 years

- **Option:** **This will set us back.**

### Event: Incoming Transmission

Evt satellite in orbit

We are picking up a scrambled transmission coming from the surface of [pre-FTL world name]. It is using a frequency normally reserved for our infiltration cells, but none of them are currently transmitting. Could this be our rogue agent?

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Rogue Agent

**Mean time to happen:** Time 450 days

- **Option:** **On screen.**

### Event: Operatives Hunted

Evt cover blown

Someone has been picking off our covert operatives on [pre-FTL world name]. Several agents that were shadowing potential [pre-FTL species name] acquisition targets have been found dead. While it's not impossible that the assassin or assassins came from an indigenous special forces outfit, the methods used in these takedowns indicate [founder species name] military training. There is a high probability that these killings are the work of our rogue operative. He knows how our infiltration cells function, and he has the training to kill both efficiently and silently.

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Incoming Transmission

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 months

- **Option:** **This is intolerable.**
 - −5 Infiltration level on the pre-FTL civilization

### Event: Media Witch Hunt

Evt news room

Reports are beginning to surface from local media outlets on [pre-FTL world name] that speak of some kind of massive global conspiracy perpetrated by aliens. The respectable [pre-FTL species name] media has yet to touch this subject matter and much of what has been reported is pure conjecture, but there are some details that could only be known by someone with intimate knowledge of our covert operations. We can only assume that our rogue agent has been feeding information about our infiltration program to the media. This will require some damage control.

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Incoming Transmission

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 months

- **Option:** **We need a firmer grip on their media.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization gains 10 Awareness

### Event: Mass Arrests

Evt smugglers in bar

One of our infiltration cells on [pre-FTL world name] has been all but eliminated in just the last couple of days. The authorities of the nation state in which they were stationed have been hunting them down one by one. Those of our operatives who were in danger of being arrested committed suicide by disintegration as standing protocol dictates. The cell's remaining members are in hiding now, and we are currently working on getting them offworld. Someone must have tipped the local authorities off and supplied them with a list of all the operatives that were part of this particular cell. Only our rogue agent could have had this information...

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Incoming Transmission

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 months

- **Option:** **He must be stopped.**
 - −10 Infiltration level on the pre-FTL civilization

### Event: Rogue Agent Sighted

Evt colony settlement

Military Intelligence has managed to pinpoint what they believe to be the location of our rogue operative on [colony name]! A ground assault to extract or terminate him would draw too much attention, but it should be possible to destroy the entire city block he is in through limited orbital bombardment. Our infiltration cells have prepared a cover story for the local media that will blame the destruction on a meteor strike. We should strike quickly... we may never get another opportunity like this!

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Incoming Transmission

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 months

- **Option:** **Bombard the city block.**
 - Issue Special Project: Eliminate Rogue Agent
- **Option:** **No... too messy and too risky. Leave [him or her] be.**
 - Spy Network on the pre-FTL civilization loses all Infiltration
- **Option:** **Remove [him or her] discretely.**

### Event: Rogue Agent Eliminated

Evt burning settlement

The captain of the [science ship name] has reported a successful fire mission, with several confirmed hits on the primary target. Although no body has been recovered, no living thing within the city block that was targeted could have survived the firepower unleashed upon it. The media appears to be picking up on the story our infiltration cells have been feeding them: a sudden meteor shower that struck a densely populated urban zone. Very tragic.

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Rogue Agent Sighted

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Eliminate Rogue Agent special project

- **Option:** **Very tragic indeed.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization gains 10 Awareness if Partially Aware

### Event: Agent Lost

Evt infiltration neutral

It is too late. The window to eliminate our rogue agent on [pre-FTL world name] has passed - our intelligence sources indicate that he has relocated together with his [pre-FTL species name] sweetheart to another safe house at an unknown location.

**Trigger conditions:** [pre-FTL world name]: Rogue Agent Sighted

**Is triggered only by:** The Eliminate Rogue Agent special project expires

- **Option:** **We trained [him or her] too well...**
 - Spy Network on the pre-FTL civilization loses all Infiltration


# Shuttle Crash

Shuttle Crash is a pre-FTL civilization event chain that can trigger if an Observation Post is conducting Passive Observation. It can only happen once per game. Most of the event chain can be averted if a special project is completed. Once the event chain starts, dismantling the Observation Post or revealing the empire's presence will no longer be possible until the event chain ends one way or another.

### Event: Shuttle Crash on [pre-FTL world name]

Evt exploding ship

During a clandestine mission to the surface of [pre-FTL world name], one of our shuttles was intercepted by a squadron of atmospheric fighters belonging to a local nation state. A lucky missile hit disabled the shuttle's engines, and it crashed in a remote wilderness region. We need to act fast if we are to evacuate any survivors before the natives reach the crash site. All evidence of our presence must be removed!

**Trigger conditions:** Pre-FTL civilization reached at least Machine Age

**Mean time to happen:** Time 5000 months

- **Option:** **Time is short.**
 - Issue Special Project: Rescue Shuttle Survivors
 - Pre-FTL civilization gains 30 Awareness
 - If the Non-interference Act resolution has been passed the empire will be in breach of galactic law for 10 years

### Event: Operatives Rescued on [pre-FTL world name]

Evt landing ship

Operatives from the [science ship name] managed to evacuate several survivors from the crashed shuttle on [pre-FTL world name]. The remaining debris was destroyed in a controlled explosion, leaving nothing but a small crater for the natives to find. The nation state where this incident occurred will no doubt blame its neighbors for this border violation, but the disruption to their natural development should hopefully prove minimal.

**Trigger conditions:** Shuttle Crash on [pre-FTL world name]

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Rescue Shuttle Survivors special project

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Society Research Gained: 350-100000

### Event: Operatives Captured on [pre-FTL world name]

Evt society research

Native forces on [pre-FTL world name] arrived at the crash site before we could get to our downed research team, and all survivors have been captured. The natives have established a perimeter around the shuttle wreckage, and their best scientists are no doubt in the process of analyzing it. They now have indisputable evidence that life exists beyond their own world. Exactly what effect this will have on their society remains to be seen...

**Trigger conditions:** Shuttle Crash on [pre-FTL world name]

**Is triggered only by:** The Rescue Shuttle Survivors special project expires

- **Option:** **This is not good.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization becomes Fully Aware

### Event: Disaster Looms on [pre-FTL world name]

Evt society research

The technology scavenged from our downed shuttle on [pre-FTL world name] poses a threat to all life on the planet. Lacking our scientific understanding, they could easily use our tech to destroy themselves. Unless we intervene, this will be a disaster.

**Trigger conditions:** Operatives Captured on [pre-FTL world name] Pre-FTL civilization reached Atomic Age or Early Space Age 33% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Activate shuttle self-destruct.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization gains 100 Awareness
- **Option:** **The damage is already done.**

### Event: New Weapons on [pre-FTL world name]

Evt ground combat

The nation state on [pre-FTL world name] that shot down our shuttle has forced our captured scientists to design new instruments of war for their military. With this new equipment, they have successfully invaded several neighboring states and are now in the process of uniting the entire [planet or moon] under their rule.

**Trigger conditions:** Operatives Captured on [pre-FTL world name] 33% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **This is intolerable!**
 - Pre-FTL civilization makes 50% progress towards the next age

### Event: Hostage Deal

Evt satellite in orbit

The nation state on [pre-FTL world name] that shot down our shuttle has sent an open transmission into space through one of their primitive satellites. It appears to be intended for us. They are demanding that we share some of our advanced technology with them in exchange for the lives of the scientists they captured at the shuttle crash site. If we refuse, our scientists are to be publicly executed live on their crude televised broadcasting system.

**Trigger conditions:** Operatives Captured on [pre-FTL world name] Pre-FTL civilization is not Xenophile 33% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **The safety of our people comes first.**
 - −75
 - Pre-FTL civilization makes 50% progress towards the next age
- **Option:** **The safety of our autonomous units comes first.**
 - −75
 - Pre-FTL civilization makes 50% progress towards the next age
- **Option:** **They are clearly not ready.**

### Event: [pre-FTL world name] Descends Into Nuclear War

Evt nuclear explosion

Several of the nation states on [pre-FTL world name] have banded together against the one that shot down our shuttle, after the latter refused to share the technologies they recovered from the crash site. Following a brief conventional war, both sides obliterated each other in a massive exchange of nuclear missiles that ruined most of the [planet or moon]. There are no survivors on the surface, including our captured scientists, and the environment has taken significant damage.

**Trigger conditions:** Disaster Looms on [pre-FTL world name] 50% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 100 days

- **Option:** **If only our shuttle had made it out...**
 - Pre-FTL world becomes a Tomb World with the Metal Boneyards planetary feature
 - Pre-FTL civilization is destroyed

### Event: [pre-FTL world name] Descends Into Nuclear War

Evt nuclear explosion

Several of the nation states on [pre-FTL world name] have banded together against the one that shot down our shuttle, after the latter refused to share the technologies they recovered from the crash site. Following a brief conventional war, both sides obliterated each other in a massive exchange of nuclear missiles that ruined most of the [planet or moon]. The [planet or moon] has suffered extensive damage, with the destruction of every major city and more than 90% of the population. Scattered survivors have emerged from the rubble, but our researchers predict that the [planet or moon]'s civilization will be regressing to a far less developed state. Our captured scientists are counted among the billions of dead.

**Trigger conditions:** Disaster Looms on [pre-FTL world name] 50% chance

**Mean time to happen:** Time 100 days

- **Option:** **If only our shuttle had made it out...**
 - Pre-FTL world becomes a Tomb World with the Metal Boneyards planetary feature
 - Pre-FTL civilization reverts to Stone Age with only 2 Pops and its origin becomes Post-Apocalyptic
 - Pre-FTL civilization becomes Completely Unaware

### Event: Hostages Executed

Evt alien propaganda

In what can only be described as an obscene spectacle, our captured scientists on [pre-FTL world name] were paraded in front of the cameras on live television as "alien horrors." They were then brutally dismembered in front of a cheering crowd.

**Trigger conditions:** Hostage Deal Not paying Influence

**Mean time to happen:** Time 20 days

- **Option:** **Deplorable!**
 - Hostages Executed modifier added for 60 months, giving the following effects: Monthly Unity −10%

## DLC features

You are not alone! The galaxy is vast and full of wonders, but it's also full of alien empires you're going to encounter, whether you're ready or not.

First Contact offers a set of new origins and mechanics that give players the chance to tell stories about their civilizations' early encounters with visitors from the stars — ones that may not have come in peace:

Event trigger **New Origins**

- **Broken Shackles** : You didn't take to the stars; you were taken to the stars as an alien captive! Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin… and will your former captors take notice?
- **Payback** : No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own — until they invaded. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you're about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!
- **Fear of the Dark** : As you've explored your home system, you've always suspected you weren't alone in the galaxy… especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an "incident" a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?

Event trigger **New Pre-FTL Interaction Options**

- What will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story?
- New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?

Event trigger **Cloaking Technology**

- Nobody saw this feature coming!
- Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware.
- Keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts.
- Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong... you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!

# Is There Life In There

Is There Life In There? is a pre-FTL civilization event chain that can trigger if a pre-FTL civilization is being observed. It can only happen once per game.

### Event: Is There Life in There?

Evt alien segregation

Even after meeting us, the [pre-FTL species plural] refuse to accept the existence of extraterrestrial life. They claim we're not interstellar visitors, but subterranean dwellers who climbed to the planet's surface through a hole in the ground. Their planet, [pre-FTL planet name], is thought to be hollow, and they believe we fly inside this central cavity using our spaceships. These baffling beliefs are hindering our diplomatic efforts. Everything we say or do is met with the utmost suspicion.

**Trigger conditions:** Pre-FTL Civilization does not have the Subterranean origin Pre-FTL Civilization reached Industrial Age

**Mean time to happen:** Time 166 years

- **Option:** **Bring their most influential skeptics to space.**
 - The pre-FTL civilization refuses all diplomatic actions
- **Option:** **[pre-FTL planet name] is not hollow! Show them the calculations!**
 - The pre-FTL civilization refuses all diplomatic actions
- **Option:** **Admit we are subterranean invaders.**
 - The pre-FTL civilization refuses all diplomatic actions

### Event: Proving Skeptics Wrong

Evt ship in orbit 2

Turns out the [pre-FTL species plural] don't believe in space, either: they think the sky is a glass dome filled with mirrors: stars are rays of sunlight reflected from the mirrors, as are the other celestial bodies. Even if we were to bring them to our capital, they would probably claim they had never left their home planet, or something equally absurd.

**Trigger conditions:** Is There Life in There? Brought their most influential skeptics to space

**Mean time to happen:** Time 15 days

- **Option:** **There must be a way to sway them...**

### Event: Proving Skeptics Wrong

Evt friendly enlightenment

Mixed news from [pre-FTL planet name]: while the [pre-FTL species plural] don't think we are visitors from the center of their [planet or moon] anymore, they are now convinced their world is flat, and people like us live on hanging cities beneath [pre-FTL planet name]'s crust.

**Trigger conditions:** Is There Life in There? Showed them the calculations

**Mean time to happen:** Time 15 days

- **Option:** **There must be a way to sway them...**
 - Society Research Gained: 250-100000
 - The pre-FTL civilization gains the Flat World Theory civic

### Event: Proving Skeptics Right

Evt hand shake

The [pre-FTL species plural] thank us for our honesty. Of course they can't fully trust us yet, since they still believe we are invaders from the Hollow [pre-FTL planet name], but at least they understand we wish them no harm and are looking forward to collaborating with us.

**Trigger conditions:** Is There Life in There? Admitted we are subterranean invaders

**Mean time to happen:** Time 15 days

- **Option:** **There must be a way to sway them...**
 - The pre-FTL civilization no longer refuses all diplomatic actions

### Event: Subterranean Invasion Defense Force

Evt mining operations

After having determined we are the secret inhabitants of Hollow [pre-FTL planet name], the [pre-FTL species plural] have started worrying about what else may be lurking under the surface of [planet or moon]. Military forces have been stationed near caves, faults and volcanoes, poised to meet any further underground invaders with force.

**Trigger conditions:** Is There Life in There?

**Mean time to happen:** Time 45 days

- **Option:** **Play along. Offer them military support.**
 - Issue Special Project: Subterranean Invasion Defense Force
- **Option:** **This is ludicrous.**

### Event: Sudden Eruption!

Evt molten planet

The [pre-FTL species plural] were right to be afraid: while not home to any underground race, the molten core of their planet has proven dangerous enough. The sudden eruption of a seemingly extinct volcano was devastating.

**Trigger conditions:** Subterranean Invasion Defense Force 35% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Subterranean Invasion Defense Force special project or 1-3 years pass

- **Option:** **At least they trust us now.**
 - Adds an Active Volcano blocker to the pre-FTL planet
 - 300 pre-FTL pops are killed if the Subterranean Invasion Defense Force special project was completed

### Event: Sudden Attack!

Evt underground civilization

Incredible news from [pre-FTL planet name]: someone really was hiding under the surface! Subterranean armies of a previously unknown species are pouring out of caves, and they're attacking the [pre-FTL species plural]. It's a full-scale invasion!

**Trigger conditions:** Subterranean Invasion Defense Force 35% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Subterranean Invasion Defense Force special project or 1-3 years pass

- **Option:** **Disconcerting.**
 - 3 industrial armies invade the pre-FTL planet
 - 3 defense armies protect the planet if the Subterranean Invasion Defense Force special project was completed
- **Option:** **[Subterranean Civilization] This feels familiar...**
 - 3 industrial armies invade the pre-FTL planet
 - 3 defense armies protect the planet if the Subterranean Invasion Defense Force special project was completed

### Event: Anticlimatic

Evt underground civilization

The Subterranean Invasion Defense Force troops stationed near the biggest caves and volcanoes report that absolutely nothing has emerged from beneath the surface. It's probably for the best, although some of the soldiers look visibly disappointed.

**Trigger conditions:** Subterranean Invasion Defense Force 30% chance

**Is triggered only by:** Finishing the Subterranean Invasion Defense Force special project or 1-3 years pass

- **Option:** **Acknowledged.**

### Event: Go Back Underground!

Evt victorious army

After a long, hard-fought battle, our combined forces triumphed over the subterranean invaders, forcing them back under [pre-FTL planet name]'s surface!

**Trigger conditions:** Sudden Attack! Finished the Subterranean Invasion Defense Force special project

**Is triggered only by:** The invading armies are defeated

- **Option:** **Excellent.**

### Event: As Above, so Below

Evt ground combat

After a vicious world war, the [pre-FTL civilization name] has been annihilated by the subterranean race living under [pre-FTL planet name]'s surface. The newly dominant species is aware of our presence, and in something of a mixed blessing, obviously does not believe we come from the center of their planet.

**Trigger conditions:** Sudden Attack! Did not finish the Subterranean Invasion Defense Force special project

**Is triggered only by:** The invading armies are victorious

- **Option:** **Finally, reasonable neighbors.**
 - The pre-FTL civilization is replaced by a random pre-FTL civilization with the Subterranean origin

### Event: A Change Of Perspective

Evt galactic community

The [pre-FTL species plural] would like to offer us their thanks, as well as an official apology. They now understand we are not, in fact, subterranean dwellers, but we come from another place entirely: the center of their star. Their grasp of cosmology is still less than perfect, but at least now they are ready to trust us.

**Trigger conditions:** Sudden Eruption!, Anticlimatic or Go Back Underground!

**Mean time to happen:** Time 15 days

- **Option:** **A sociologically interesting but mentally exhausting experience.**
 - Society Research Gained: 1000-1000000
 - The pre-FTL civilization no longer refuses all diplomatic actions


# Propulsion Proponent Proclamation

Propulsion Proponent Proclamation is a brief pre-FTL civilization event chain that can trigger if a pre-FTL civilization is being observed. It can only happen once per game. Getting the event chain is necessary to unlock the No Good Deed achievement.

### Event: Propulsion Proponent Proclamation

Evt early space age

We have received reports of superluminal spacecraft propulsion on [pre-FTL world name]. The inhabitants seem intent on becoming a full-fledged spacefaring civilization. What they discover in the stars may prove too much for them to comprehend.

**Trigger conditions:** Not In Violation of Galactic Law Not 100 Awareness Pre-FTL Civilization reached Early Space Age

**Mean time to happen:** Time 166 years

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - +30 Observation Insights situation progress
 - Next Insight will be a Physics technology unless all were already discovered
 - A space station appears above the pre-FTL civilization's homeworld

### Event: Much To Gain, Yet Much to Lose

Evt early space age

The existence of a theoretically FTL-capable craft on [pre-FTL world name] is now confirmed. They have moved on to testing, hoping to soon break the light speed barrier. If they are successful, they will technically be ready to engage in galactic diplomacy. Such an encounter is sure to have profound effects on their society, for good or ill.

**Trigger conditions:** Propulsion Proponent Proclamation

**Mean time to happen:** Time 500 days

- **Option:** **They are not ready. Sabotage their mission.**
 - A ship appears next to the pre-FTL space station
 - +10 Observation Insights situation progress
 - If the Non-interference Act resolution has been passed the empire will be in breach of galactic law for 10 years
- **Option:** **We grow weary. Speed them along on their way.**
 - A ship appears next to the pre-FTL space station
 - If the Non-interference Act resolution has been passed the empire will be in breach of galactic law for 10 years
- **Option:** **Xenophile,They must learn on their own. Observe from a distance.**
 - A ship appears next to the pre-FTL space station
 - +10 Observation Insights situation progress
- **Option:** **Xenophile,Change our approach. Help them reach the stars!**
 - A ship appears next to the pre-FTL space station
 - If the Non-interference Act resolution has been passed the empire will be in breach of galactic law for 10 years

### Event: Complete Separation

Evt sabotaged ship

The aspiring spacefarers on [pre-FTL world name] attempted to break the light speed barrier. The whole world looked on as the spacecraft launched towards the stars. Liftoff was a success. Everything was operating within expected parameters. Then they engaged their warp drive and things took a turn. They successfully distorted the shape of the space-time continuum (a fascinating but flawed approach to breaking the light speed barrier), however they were only successful in doing this in the aft section of the craft. The resulting carnage was beyond anything the inhabitants of [pre-FTL world name] could have ever imagined. The crew was violently distorted, fixed in one part of space, whilst simultaneously having other parts of themselves stretched into the future. It could be some time before they are ready for a second attempt.

**Trigger conditions:** Much To Gain, Yet Much to Lose Gained Observation Insights situation progress

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1000 days

- **Option:** **As expected. Their failure was inevitable.**
 - The pre-FTL ship and space station are destroyed
 - Pre-FTL civilization regresses to Atomic Age
- **Option:** **Xenophile,Had we warned them, they would be spacefarers now...**
 - The pre-FTL ship and space station are destroyed
 - Pre-FTL civilization regresses to Atomic Age

### Event: Spacefaring Commences

Evt early space age

The people of [pre-FTL world name] have made remarkable progress on their experimental jump drive, however there were some glaring mistakes in their calculations relating to the projected range of their space-time distortion generator. By engaging in direct communication, we were able to guide them towards the accepted method of faster than light travel via hyperlane network. Following our advice, [pre-FTL world name] will soon join us as a galactic spacefaring society.

**Trigger conditions:** Much To Gain, Yet Much to Lose Did not gain Observation Insights situation progress

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1000 days

- **Option:** **We await their arrival into the wider galactic community.**
 - +10 Observation Insights situation progress
 - +750 Permanent Opinion with the pre-FTL civilization
 - Pre-FTL civilization gains 100 Awareness
 - If the Non-interference Act resolution has been passed the empire will be in breach of galactic law for 10 years and gain the No Good Deed achievement if in ironman mode

### Event: Among Us

Evt ship in orbit 3

The inhabitants of [pre-FTL world name] have joined the wider galactic community as a spacefaring society! Our observation mission now concludes, as they are now FTL capable.

**Trigger conditions:** Spacefaring Commences

**Mean time to happen:** Time 1000 days

- **Option:** **They would do well to stay out of our way.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization's homeworld is annexed
- **Option:** **Xenophile,Welcome to the galaxy.**
 - Pre-FTL civilization becomes an empire and takes control of the system

## Random events


# Colony events

Colony events can trigger 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 years after a planet or ring world is colonized. Each colony can only get one colony event, and planets that have been Terraformed are blocked from getting any event except for ones guaranteed by a Planet modifiers, Planet Modifier. Most events are limited to once per empire, although some are limited to once per game and some have lighter or no limits.

## Generic colony event triggers

The following trigger conditions apply to all colony events, unless otherwise noted:

- Planet owner
 - Yes Planet is owned by the original owner
 - No Planet owner is not AI

- Planet
 - No Planet hasn't had a colony event
 - No Planet hasn't been terraformed
 - No Colony isn't a Habitat
 - No Planet isn't a species homeworld
 - No Planet isn't an empire's capital
 - No Planet doesn't have ground combat and isn't occupied
 - Colony has at least one Pop

## Guaranteed events

Certain planet modifiers or planetary features will trigger a guaranteed colony event, usually when the colony turns one year old.

| Event | Planet modifier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| What Happened Here? | Irradiated | No Planets can't get this modifier , so this event can never trigger. (Unless the game is modded .) |
| Titanic Life | Titanic Life | |
| Earthquake! | Unstable Tectonics | |
| Comet Sighted Through Belt | Asteroid Belt | |
| Crackdown | Atmospheric Hallucinogen | |
| Magnetic Miracle | Strong Magnetic Field | Both events have a 50% chance to trigger. |
| Magnetic Disruption | | |

| Event | Planetary feature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| An Unexpected Friend | Enigmatic Robot<br>- No Can't be found on artificial worlds<br>- ×3 on Relic Worlds | - Time Event triggers when the colony turns 2 years old.<br>- Gestalt Consciousness empires can't get the anomaly that creates the feature, but they can still get the event if they're the first empire to colonize the planet it's on. |

## Random events

If a colony doesn't get a guaranteed event when it's one year old, it's eligible to start rolling for a random colony event when it reaches two years old. Continental Worlds are the only class of planet with access to every single existing colony event that isn't Tomb World exclusive, and Desert Worlds are the only class of planet that only has access to colony events that are also available to every other regular planet class.

Because terraforming prevents colony events, you can't use it to try to get events that are restricted to certain planet classes. Additionally, if you want to have a chance to get any colony event, and aren't also looking for one of the terraforming events that can only trigger on uninhabited planets, you should always colonize planets that don't have a planet modifier that gives a guaranteed event before terraforming them and then wait to terraform them until they either get a colony event or reach five years old.

It may be worth considering which restricted colony events your guaranteed habitable worlds will have access to when selected your species' climate preference .

Habitats can't get colony events.

| Event | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Other Restrictions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### Event chances

When the colony is 1 year old, certain planet modifiers will trigger a guaranteed event . At 2 and 3 years old, there are a large variety of possible random events, while there is a much shorter list of possible events when the colony is 4 or 5 years old. The odds of any specific event triggering is equal to that event's weight divided by the total weight of no event plus all potential events for that colony age.

## Ethics divergence events

These colony events involve changing the ethics of some pops to the opposing ethic. They have no limit on how many times they can happen, but they share a limit on how often an event in this category can happen. An empire can't get any ethics divergence colony event more then once every five years.

### Event: Trouble in Paradise

Evt smugglers in bar

Event trigger **The below description is one of several available for this event.**

As we have grown our roots on [Root.GetName] certain individuals have begun to stray from our beaten path. That is to be expected, but these have supporters. The group feels our spiritualistic view of the universe is not leading us forward fast enough - assured that a more materialistic view of the cosmos is the answer.

**Trigger conditions:** Either: Empire is some degree of Spiritualist and colony has a Materialist pop Empire is some degree of Materialist and colony has a Spiritualist pop Colony has at least 4 pops that aren't non-sapient robots Time Empire hasn't had an ethics divergence event within the last 5 years

Evt throne room

Event trigger **The below description is one of several available for this event.**

## Archaeology site events

### Event: Fossils Discovered on [Root.GetName]

Evt archaeology camp

Fossilized remains from several different species that do not appear to have been indigenous to §H[Root.GetName]§! have been found in a large and secluded valley on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. They all date from roughly the same time period, within the span of a few centuries some 3.6 million years ago. Each of these species seems to have evolved in its own unique biosphere, and all appear to have been sapient. Strangely, every fossilized individual found so far shows signs of having met a violent end.

**Trigger conditions:** Generic colony event triggers Ancient Relics DLC is active Any regular habitable planet class No No Archaeology Site Can only happen once per game

**Is triggered only by:** Time The colony turning 2, 3, 4, or 5 years old

### Event: Message in the Canopy

Evt archaeology camp

Our scientists have discovered something unusual on [From.Planet.GetName]. A tropical world, much of the planet's surface is covered with dense jungle: massive, thousand year old trees erupt from the canopy, their leafy crowns towering over the landscape. At first glance, the distribution of these giants appears random. However, further analysis indicates that the trees are arranged with mathematical precision, and it seems likely they were planted by some long-vanished civilization. What's more, the team leader believes the distribution pattern may comprise a set of coordinates, one that points to an unexplored location deep within the jungle.

**Trigger conditions:** Generic colony event triggers Tropical, Continental, or Gaia World No No Archaeology Site Can only happen once per game

**Is triggered only by:** Time The colony turning 2 years old

### Event: Scandalous Insult

Evt assembly fight

We have caught a delegate from the [alien empire name] in a rare blunder, letting slip their empire's true feelings about us to another, anonymous party. More than the usual political mud-slinging: these amount to an outright insult , as it appears we are the subjects of fierce ridicule amongst [alien empire adjective] society. Whether or not we pay any mind to this baseless slander: diplomacy and pride would demand that we stand our ground.

### Event: Substance Abuse

Evt cover blown

Our ambassador corps has for some time been concerned at the performance of [official name], one of our officials to the [Galactic Community or federation name]. Now, evidence has come to light that [he/she/they] appear[s] to have fallen prey to an alien substance from the [alien name] that has proven extremely addictive to [founder species plural]. Although the trade in this substance is highly illegal among the [alien species plural], a lucrative black market run by cutthroat drug lords has sprung up. These drug lords, who apparently managed to introduce it to [him/her/them] as a potent aphrodisiac, now exert a considerable degree of influence over [official name], who is forced to do their bidding in return for satisfying [his/her/their] cravings.

### Event: Astute Galactic Diplomacy

Evt galactic community

Although we are not able to count ourselves among the true superpowers of this galaxy, we have often been able to punch above our weight in galactic affairs. This is largely down to the exertions of our official [official name], who ably represents our interests in the Galactic Community and commands deep respect even among those stridently opposed to all the [empire name] stands for. As a result, even though not everyone may fear the might of our navy or long to match the depths of our coffers, they nevertheless admire the prowess of our diplomatic corps.

**Trigger conditions:** Official over 60 years old assigned to Galactic Community Not part of the Galactic Council Among the top 5 empires by Diplomatic Weight

### Event: Lobbyists

Evt smear campaign

A cacophony of voices may be heard in the Galactic Community - not all of them friendly, and certainly not all of them aligning with [empire adjective] interests. Unfortunately, it seems that Ambassador [official name] has been listening to the wrong voices. Eyebrows were raised when [he/she/they] attended several conferences hosted by the [faction name] . Now it has emerged that a large sum of credits traceable to that organization were transferred to [him/her/them]. [official name]'s colleagues demand that [he/she/they] be recalled, citing trust issues. However, some of our more devious advisors suggest that we could strike a deal to keep [him/her/them] in place in return for a share of the pot.

### Event: A Contribution to Galactic Comedy

Evt galactic community

[official name], our official representing our interests in the Galactic Community, has committed a major faux pas, mistaking the [council member empire adjective] delegate for a [inferior empire species name]. Unfortunately, the incriminating remarks were witnessed by many onlookers, who duly showered [official name] with ridicule. Many now cast aspersions on the competence of our diplomatic corps, although our contribution to galactic comedy cannot be doubted.

The recent law changes in the [federation name] caused a significant stir, with old ideological debates between ourselves and the [opposing ethics empire name] once again rising to the fore. Our representative, [official name], was able to persuade many of the benefits of a more [empire ethic] outlook, highlighting the cowardice and naivety inherent in the beliefs of the [opposing ethics empire name] official, [opposing ethics empire official name]. Fortunately, the [opposing ethics empire founder species] took this in good grace, recognizing the need for compromise in the interest of a more harmonious relationship with their alliance partners.

 - Influence Gained: 25

### Event: A Strange Creature

Evt galactic community

[official name], our official to the Galactic Community, has been spending a disturbing amount of time tending to a strange, small mammalian creature that began following [him/her/them] around. Presumably a domestic pet that escaped from one of the other delegations, it is undeniably cute but shows no sign of sapient thought. Although it is highly carnivorous and exhibits sharp teeth and claws, it is generally affectionate and desires plentiful physical contact in the form of petting - though its mood swings can be sudden and violent! Although the creature has proved a distraction for [official name]'s more serious tasks, other delegates have commented on the endearing nature of the softer, more sentimental side of the [founder species name] psyche that has been revealed.

**Trigger conditions:** Official of the founder species assigned to Galactic Community Founder species does not use a human portrait Not Gestalt Consciousness United Nations of Earth or Commonwealth of Man are members of the Galactic Community Not in Federation, Overlord or Subject of United Nations of Earth or Commonwealth of Man Among the top 5 empires by Diplomatic Weight

### Event: Offense Taken

Evt alien segregation

Leaked recordings of one of our envoys' private conversations have the [alien empire name] up in arms. In a regrettable moment, "Ambassador" [envoy name] seems to have called [his or her] hosts "disgusting [alien species insult]". The [alien empire adjective] [alien empire ruler title] expressed dismay, and suggested that keeping someone so demonstrably unfit for the role in place would be "concerning".

Evt assembly fight

It appears that a mischievous third party was able to hack into the translation software of the [empire adjective] envoy to [alien empire capital name], [alien empire name], so that instead of uttering magnanimous platitudes, [he or she] began spewing vicious insults that left none unscathed. The malfunction in [his or her] equipment was duly uncovered, but not before [alien ruler title] [alien ruler name] was declared to be a "vile [alien ruler species insult]" - a grave insult which surely calls for a response.

Our [ambassador] [envoy name], who had been stationed there, has gotten themselves into a serious mess with [targeted empire adjective] law enforcement. They are currently in connection with a salacious affair involving an astonishing range of serious crimes that culminated in a brutal double murder. As matters stand - and with rumors running wild among the [targeted species plural] - there seems little doubt as to [envoy name]'s guilt. The [targeted empire adjective] authorities have requested that their diplomatic immunity be lifted so that they can face justice for their deeds.

**Trigger conditions:** Improving or harming relations with an empire Neither empire is Gestalt Consciousness

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 months

### Event: Missteps from an Ambassador

Evt smear campaign

The [envoy species plural] have brought forward a complaint regarding the conduct of our ambassador to the [federation name], [envoy name]. Apparently [his or her] conduct has so offended the local [alien species name] that their authorities have posted a guard for [hir or her] own protection. Exactly what [he or she] did is unclear to us, as we lack [alien species adjective] sensibilities, but there are widespread protests against [him or her] and the "[empire adjective] arrogance" [he or she] supposedly represents. The [alien empire name] urges us to recall [envoy name] and send a new ambassador in [his or her] place. They hint at diplomatic repercussions should we refuse.

**Trigger conditions:** Improving or harming relations with an empire Neither empire is Gestalt Consciousness

### Event: Star-Crossed Lovers

Evt diplomatic visit

It seems that, instead of performing [his or her] task and representing [empire name] interests our envoy [envoy name] has fallen for the charms of a [alien empire name] diplomat. Fearing the repercussions of this transgression, the pair have eloped to the [third empire name]: a nation whose dangerously liberal constitution permits such unions. In doing this, [envoy name] has forfeited [his or her] position as our envoy. However, this loss of control over our own envoys has hurt our galactic standing. We must restore our reputation by apprehending the miscreant!

### Event: A Most Irritating Envoy

Evt assembly fight

The [envoy species adjective] envoy, [envoy name], has been exasperatingly tiresome in [his or her] efforts to represent [envoy species adjective] interests in [capital name]. Right from [his or her] first arrival, [he or she] has shown unremitting hostility towards the [government name], unleashing an almost constant barrage of objections to our policies and actions. So great an irritation has [he or she] been that few would weep to see the back of [him or her], and we have heard whispers that a group of [empire adjective] loyalists are plotting to expedite [his or her] demise. Allowing this scheme to succeed would certainly be convenient, but allowing foreign dignitaries to be assassinated in our realm might not be the best of looks.

**Trigger conditions:** Another empire is harming relations with this one Not Fanatic Egalitarian Not Gestalt Consciousness

**Mean time to happen:** Time 60 months

### Event: Fidgeting

Evt colony settlement

The near-sapient natives of [colony name] are causing a ruckus on the outskirts of our colony. Something about the [empire name]'s continued presence here visibly agitates them, as packs of them scurry to and fro between the settlement's borders and some unknown point to the east.

 - Energy Credits: −300

### Event: In Vivo

Our terraforming specialists have discovered that it's possible to tidally lock the [planet or moon]. This occurring naturally can be quite a detriment to a colony. However, doing it during the terraforming process could allow us to exploit the endless solar hours the dayside will receive and generate an obscene amount of energy. We would still have to make a concentrated effort to set up the rest of our industry and housing on the twilight and night side.

**Trigger conditions:** Planet is not colonized Planet was not terraformed into a Gaia World or Tomb World Planet was not terraformed from a Tomb World or Barren World

**Is triggered only by:** 2% chance

- **Option:** **Do it.**
 - Intentionally Tidally Locked modifier added
- **Option:** **Set the [planet or moon] spinning again, the risk is too great.**

### Event: Unexpected Mutations

Gaia planet

Our terraforming specialists have good news and bad news for us about [planet name] . The good news is that the terraforming process went swimmingly, and we have a beautiful Gaia World. The bad news is that everyone living on the [planet or moon] was exposed to the terraforming gasses and now can't live on non-Gaia Worlds. These Gaia-trapped inhabitants have surprisingly been showing an increase in their productivity while on the Gaia World. Far better than workers that weren't affected by the gas that migrated there later.

- **Option:** **At least they don't seem to be uncomfortable.**
 - All biological pops on the planet have their climate preference trait changed to a special version of Gaia World Preference that also gives +5% Resources from Jobs on Gaia Worlds

### Event: Perfect Organization

Evt fleet from surface

Surpassing nature is not something new for this collective. During the terraforming process of [planet name] , every hill was considered, and every piece of fauna was strategically placed. The [planet or moon] has now ended up being a perfectly organized logistical paradise for our Autonomous drones to produce for the collective.

**Trigger conditions:** Gestalt Consciousness Planet was not terraformed from a Barren World

**Is triggered only by:** 2% chance

- **Option:** **How pleasing.**
 - Perfect Organization modifier added

### Event: Oneness

Evt hive mind

While turning [planet name] into [planet class] world, the terraforming drones managed to link not only the local fauna to the mind but, through freak mutations when exposed to the terraforming gasses, link the mind to the world itself. The collective now has the opportunity to become whole in a truer sense than before.

**Trigger conditions:** Hive Mind Planet was not terraformed from a Tomb World or Barren World

**Is triggered only by:** 0.5% chance

- **Option:** **Yes, the mind wills it.**
 - Planet becomes a Hive World
- **Option:** **No, this is not the intention for this world.**
 - Influence Gained: 200

### Event: [homeworld name] II

Evt atmospheric flight

We have not only succeeded in terraforming [planet name] , but we have done something even better. During the final stretch of the process, our terraforming specialists managed to make it a perfect home for our local fauna, creating a [planet or moon] eerily similar to [homeworld name]. All our local plant life is there but none of the familiar terrain.

**Trigger conditions:** Planet's new planet class matches the primary species' climate preference Can only happen once

### Event: Paradise is a Place on [planet name]

Gaia planet

Amongst our terraforming specialists assigned to [planet name] , there seem to have been followers of an ancient sect from [homeworld name] among them. These [founder species plural] believe that there is a paradise for our people, and instead of looking for it, they have now created it. [planet name] has now been turned into a [planet or moon] of the blessed, looking like an illustration manifested from the pages of our ancient history.

 - Influence Gained: 100

## DLC events

### Event: Radioactive Flora

Evt tomb world

While cleaning out the radiation in [planet name] 's atmosphere and soil, our terraforming specialists had to call in our xenobiologists. They had found a species that seemed to thrive off the radiation and was now wilting. Even more curious, this species appears to be presapient and on the cusp of achieving sentience. Now, as the final soil scrubbers are approaching, we have to decide what to do with this new life.

### Event: Weapons Cache

Evt tomb world

Restoring a Tomb World is always hard work and often very repetitive: section off an area, clear out any rubble, replace the soil, purify any remaining water, and add new fauna. As the terraforming process on [planet name] was winding to a close, our terraforming specialists discovered a sizeable underground metal container, and based on its fortifications, it is assumed that this is a weapons cache.

**Trigger conditions:** Ancient Relics DLC Planet was terraformed from a Tomb World Not a homeworld Can only happen once

**Is triggered only by:** 2% chance Guaranteed on Earth

- **Option:** **Curious.**
 - Planet gains a Weapons Cache archaeological site

### Event: Unearthed pre-FTLs

Evt underground city

While enriching the soil and adding an atmosphere to [planet name] , our terraforming specialists have made an unexpected find. Beneath the surface of planet, there exists a civilization of subterranean aliens. It must have been because of the [planet or moon]'s mineral density that our scanners didn't detect them before. The pre-FTLs seem unaware that their surface has changed, giving us a chance to do what we will with them.

### Event: Sky Burials

Evt sky burials

As we finished terraforming on [planet name] , bodies began falling from the sky. From such heights, these ancient carcasses are reduced to a pulp upon impact. Amongst the viscera we have discovered clusters of small objects - ornamental instruments and odd relics - all tumbling from the same dense clouds in the planet's upper atmosphere. These thick clouds, which we can only assume were utilized as a final resting place by some unknown alien race, are now thinning as a result of our terraforming changes and releasing the contents that were previously suspended inside. We can expect these remains to continue falling as the atmosphere settles, until the cloud graves are emptied entirely.

### Event: Blue Lava

Evt blue lava

The planetary crust of [planet name] has shifted as a result of the terraforming process, leading to an unusual natural phenomenon. The shifting tectonic plates have displaced several pockets of Exotic Gases which have reacted with the Alloy rich mineral deposits found in the planet's volcanos, causing their eruptions to develop a vivid blue hue. The volatile nature of this phenomenon has left the planet a bit less hospitable, and as a result impacted our plans to create livable space for our colonists. As a bonus, the earth around these volcanoes is now rich in resources for us to take advantage of.

**Trigger conditions:** BioGenesis DLC Planet was terraformed from a Cold climate Can only happen once

**Is triggered only by:** 5% chance

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - Adds the Blue Lava planetary feature to the planet

### Event: Hydroactive Eggs

Evt animal wildlife

The terraforming of [planet name] has caused an unexpected surge in the native fauna population. We have discovered that the breeding cycles of many local species are intrinsically linked to the availability of water in the environment. Their eggs, which previously were buried in soil for months before absorbing enough water to hatch, are now littering the landscape in abundance. The planet's fauna numbers are skyrocketing at a logarithmic pace. Many of these creatures are highly nutritious; they will provide an abundant food source for [planet name] , as well as opportunities to study an extremely active ecosystem. Visitors to this planet will now be required to undergo an extensive screening process upon departure to prevent outworld contamination.

**Trigger conditions:** BioGenesis DLC Planet was terraformed from a Dry climate to a Cold or Wet climate Can only happen once

**Is triggered only by:** 5% chance

- **Option:** **Good.**
 - Adds the Hydroactive Eggs planetary feature to the planet
- **Option:** **Could this pace be replicated?**
 - Adds the Hydroactive Eggs planetary feature to the planet
 - The Adaptive Evolution situation advances by 10

### Event: Mineralized Lava Tubes

Evt mineralized lava tube

Drying the climate on [planet name] uncovered a vast network of lava tubes throughout the planet's newly-exposed ocean floor. The magma flows which created these deep tunnels are dormant now, leaving behind a rich seam of minerals forged long ago in the extreme heat and pressure of [planet name] 's molten core. These pyroduct deposits are extremely dense; extraction operations here will be costly but highly lucrative.

**Trigger conditions:** BioGenesis DLC Planet was terraformed from a Cold or Wet climate to a Dry climate Can only happen once

**Is triggered only by:** 5% chance

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Adds the Lava Tubes planetary feature to the planet

### Event: Suspended in Ice

Evt suspended in ice

Our terraforming efforts on [planet name] revealed a surprising number of native fauna buried within the surface ice. Even more astonishing is that these creatures are somehow still alive. The species appears to have been in the midst of an exceptionally deep hibernation; an effective method for surviving [planet name] 's lengthy ice ages. Thawing caused by the terraforming process has prematurely brought their stasis to an end. Roused from their icy slumber, the creatures are already demonstrating glimpses of intelligence, utilizing simple tools in their food-gathering efforts.

**Trigger conditions:** BioGenesis DLC Planet was terraformed from a Cold climate to a Dry or Wet climate Can only happen once

### Event: Mountains of Steel

Evt frozen

An impending issue on [planet name] has been flagged by our terraforming specialists. Beneath the frozen mountain ranges of the planet lie vast, highly concentrated deposits of iron and carbon, all of which were superheated by the terraforming process. We could safely remove the near-molten resources now. Alternatively, by allowing the superheating to continue, we would foster a perpetual source of alloys. Of course, this would come at the cost of habitable living space.

**Trigger conditions:** BioGenesis DLC Planet was terraformed from a Cold climate to a Dry climate Can only happen once

**Is triggered only by:** 5% chance

- **Option:** **Prioritize the resources.**
 - Minerals Gained: 250-5000
 - Alloys Gained: 250-5000
- **Option:** **Do nothing.**
 - Adds the Mountains of Steel planetary feature to the planet

### Event: Perpetual Lightning

Evt perpetual lightning

We have received reports of an emerging weather phenomenon on [planet name] . Crystal deposits within the bedrock of the planet have become exposed during terraforming, reacting to the chemicals used in the process and becoming irradiated. The resulting fluctuations in air temperature have created a perpetual planet-wide lightning storm. These unique weather conditions will inevitably impact infrastructure development, and the irradiated crystals are sure to have consequences for long-term habitability. However, our scientists are confident they can harness the energy of the storms once terraforming is complete. Alternatively, our engineers have also drawn up plans to safely neutralize the charge in the crystal deposits. This should dissipate the storms and allow us to safely harvest them for other uses.

**Trigger conditions:** BioGenesis DLC Planet was terraformed from a Dry climate to a Wet climate Can only happen once

**Is triggered only by:** 5% chance

- **Option:** **Exploit the energy in these storms.**
 - Perpetual Lightning modifier added
- **Option:** **Neutralize the crystals.**
 - Adds the Crystalline Growth planetary feature to the planet

### Event: Combustible Atmosphere

Evt desert

Terraforming on [planet name] had unforeseen consequences. Unbeknown to us, the planet's topsoil was a fine particle mix containing high concentrations of Volatile Motes which our terraforming process disturbed and seeded throughout the planet's atmosphere. Unfortunately, these airborne high-energy particles increase the risk of unintended combustion events on the surface. Any future colony will have to prioritize accident and conflict prevention in order to avoid devastating consequences. However if we are able to manage the dangers carefully, the atmosphere of [planet name] will become a rich source of these rare materials.

**Trigger conditions:** BioGenesis DLC Discovered Volatile Motes Can only happen once

**Is triggered only by:** 5% chance

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - Adds the Explosive Atmosphere planetary feature to the planet
 - Adds the Mote Stabilization technology as a permanent research option if not already researched


# Tomb world events

Tomb World colony events have a large chance to trigger 2 or 3 years after a Tomb World has been colonized. Each event can only happen once per empire. Unlike most other colony events, tomb world colony events can still happen if the planet has already had a different colony event. These events can only happen on planets which were Tomb Worlds from the start, and not those that were made that way by terraforming or orbital bombardment.

### Event: Ruined Particle Accelerator

Evt physics research

We have discovered what appears to be the remains of a massive particle accelerator on [colony name]. It was found in a still-radioactive region covered in massive bomb craters, suggesting the accelerator was considered a strategic target of great importance during the [planet or moon]'s nuclear war. We have recovered several research logs written by the scientist in charge of the accelerator. Although the technology of her civilization was fairly primitive, some of the theoretical research and formulas described in the logs are advanced even by our standards. Our physicists are poring over the data now.

**Trigger conditions:** Colony is not a species homeworld

**Is triggered only by:** Time The colony turning 2 or 3 years old

- **Option:** **Fascinating.**
 - Adds an Ancient Particle Accelerator planetary feature to the colony

### Event: Surviving Infrastructure

Evt city ruins

Infrastructure that survived the great nuclear war which ruined [colony name] have proved a great boon to our colonists. The alien civilization that once lived here built highways connecting their major population centers, and some of them are still in good enough condition to be used today. We have also been able to recycle a large amount of building material from the many ruins that dot the landscape, further improving our colony's infrastructure.

**Trigger conditions:** Colony is not a species homeworld

**Is triggered only by:** Time The colony turning 2 or 3 years old

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Surviving Infrastructure modifier added, giving the following effects: District Cost −25%

### Event: Nuclear Bomb

Evt colony settlement

While exploring some ruins near one of our major settlements on [colony name], a few colonists inadvertently activated the timer on an undetonated hydrogen bomb left over from the [planet or moon]'s previous nuclear war. With an estimated yield of 35 megatons, the bomb will wipe out several population centers if it detonates. It isn't stable enough to be moved and there is no time to evacuate the entire region.

**Trigger conditions:** Colony is not a species homeworld

**Is triggered only by:** Time The colony turning 2 or 3 years old

- **Option:** **We must disarm it!**
 - Issue Special Project: Disarm Nuclear Bomb
 - If the special project expires a pop will die and the colony will gain +20 Devastation

### Event: Derelict Space Station

Evt satellite in orbit

A small team from our colony on [colony name] recently boarded a primitive space station that had been left in orbit by the [planet or moon]'s original inhabitants. The mummified remains of the station's crew could still be found clustered around viewports facing the [planet or moon]. They must have realized they were doomed after seeing the billowing mushroom clouds below, and communication logs shows that the astronauts made several futile and increasingly frantic attempts to contact the surface before they eventually ran out of supplies. The station is in good condition, and it has afforded our engineers a rare glimpse of the early stages of a planetary space program. They have gained several ideas from the primitive yet ingenious solutions used in the station's design.

**Trigger conditions:** Colony is not a species homeworld Planet wasn't made into a Tomb World by primitives nuking themselves

**Is triggered only by:** Time The colony turning 2 or 3 years old

- **Option:** **Intriguing.**
 - Engineering Research Gained: 250-100000

### Event: Wasteland Radiation

Evt colony settlement

The radiation levels in some wasteland regions of [colony name] appear to be greater than our previous scans had indicated. Colonists in several local settlements have complained of poor health, and birth rates are down. We are taking steps to evacuate the affected regions, but these measures will take time.

**Trigger conditions:** Colony is not a species homeworld Not Gestalt Consciousness

**Is triggered only by:** Time The colony turning 2 or 3 years old

- **Option:** **Unfortunate.**
 - Wasteland Radiation modifier added for 120 months, giving the following effects: Biological Pop Happiness −10%

### Event: Pacifist Movement

Evt smugglers in bar

The decrepit ruins and desolate wastelands found on [colony name] seem to have prompted many of the [planet or moon]'s colonists to adopt some kind of pacifistic philosophy. Members of this new movement claim that the environment they live in serve as a daily reminder of the senseless horrors of war. They see it as their civic duty to prevent the terrible destruction visited upon [colony name] from occurring on other worlds.

**Trigger conditions:** Colony is not a species homeworld Not Gestalt Consciousness Colony has a free Pop that's not Mechanical or Pacifist

**Is triggered only by:** Time The colony turning 2 or 3 years old

- **Option:** **Do they, now?**
 - Up to 4 Pops on the colony change ethics to Pacifist
- **Option:** **These wretched cowards shame our nation!**
 - Up to 4 Pops on the colony change ethics to Pacifist
- **Option:** **Excellent. Everyone should give peace a chance.**
 - Up to 4 Pops on the colony change ethics to Pacifist

### Underground Vault

The Underground Vault event chain has its own page.

### Event: Orbital Debris

Evt satellite in orbit

The orbital space around [Root.GetName] is cluttered with debris left behind by the alien civilization that once inhabited the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]. Before they wiped themselves out, their early space programs saw the launch of thousands of primitive satellites and missile launch platforms. Many of these were destroyed by anti-satellite weapons during the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s destructive nuclear war, adding even more space junk to the mix. Our colony on the surface has developed to a point where this dense field of debris is interfering with its infrastructure. We cannot use satellites and civilian orbital flights are limited to narrow launch windows.

**Trigger conditions:** Generic Tomb World colony event triggers Planet wasn't made into a Tomb World by primitives nuking themselves

**Is triggered only by:**

- **Option:** **Perhaps something should be done.**
 - Orbital Debris, planet modifier added, with the following effects:
 - +10% Building cost
 - Enables the Remove Orbital Debris special project

### Event: Freighter Crash

Evt atmospheric entry

A civilian freighter coming in to land on [Root.GetName] was perforated by a dense cloud of fast-moving orbital debris! The flight crew was killed immediately, and the stricken craft tumbled through the atmosphere only to crash-land near one of the colony's main power relays. The resulting explosion resulted in several deaths on the ground, and local infrastructure suffered considerable damage.

**Trigger conditions:** Orbital Debris, planet modifier Can only happen once

**Mean time to happen:** Time 20 years

- **Option:** **Of all the luck...!**
 - An Impact Crater blocker is added to the planet

### Event: Debris Impact

Evt atmospheric entry

A cascade of collisions in the dense layer of debris surrounding [Root.GetName] recently shifted the orbit of a large piece of space junk. The object - which we believe was one of the many orbital missile platforms used in the [Root.GetPlanetMoon]'s nuclear war - was pulled into the atmosphere, and unfortunately proceeded to impact directly on top of a major settlement. Initial reports indicate heavy casualties.

**Trigger conditions:** Orbital Debris, planet modifier Can only happen once

**Mean time to happen:** Time 20 years

- **Option:** **We really need to do something about that debris.**
 - A random Pop on the colony dies

### Event: Special Project Completed

# Apocalypse

### Event: Apocalypse

Expansion

2018-02-22 / 2.0

Paradox / Steam

**<< Previous DLC** **Next DLC >>**

**Apocalypse** is the second major expansion for Stellaris. It was announced on 2018-01-11 and released on 2018-02-22 The expansion was accompanied by the free 2.0 patch (aka Cherryh ).

## Expansion features

These features are only available if the accompanying DLC is activated.

Event trigger **Planetary destruction**

- Ability to construct a special late-game planet-killer ship nicknamed " Colossus ", a technological super-weapon that can, in one of its 5 configurations, shatter entire worlds.

Event trigger **Titan class ships**

- Players are now capable of building strong capital-sized ships that offer tremendous bonuses to vessels under their command.

Event trigger **Ion cannons**

- Starbases can deploy expensive defense modules that hit targets on the other side of the system with a powerful attack.

Event trigger **Marauders**

- Nomadic empires can now spawn on the fringes of the galaxy and raid settled nations. Players can hire mercenary generals and admirals from them and order a raid on a rival if relations are high enough. There is also a chance these scattered hordes coalesce into a unified force, potentially triggering a mid-game crisis event.

Event trigger **More civics and ascension perks**

- Further customize the inter-stellar empires.

## Free features

These features will be added to the base game on the 2.0 (Cherryh) patch meaning that they are free for all players and function without the need of the accompanying DLC.

- **Border rework** – Borders are now simply a reflection of system ownership meaning that the owner of a system is now almost always the owner of the Starbase in said system.
- **Starbases** – Each system can now only have a single Starbase above its sun. They can be upgraded, ranging from outpost to citadel, and further specialized with modules and buildings. Starbases replace spaceports in military ship construction. Constructing a Starbase costs influence and they can never be destroyed, only disabled or captured.
- **Colonization changes** – It is now impossible to colonize worlds outside an empires' borders, but it no longer costs influence to do so.
- **FTL overhaul** – The game no longer allows players to select the starting FTL type, instead everyone starts as primarily hyperlane-based, with more advanced forms of FTL unlocked through technology. Hyperlane generation has been altered, now creating more 'islands' and 'choke points', allowing for a more interesting galactic geography. Ships now need to travel to the entry point of a particular hyperlane but to compensate sublight travel has been sped up. Wormholes are now a natural formation that can be encountered while exploring the galaxy. They work in pairs and essentially function as very long hyperlanes that can potentially take a ship across the entire galaxy near-instantly. Jump drives have also been tweaked, they normally travel across hyperlanes like any normal ship but they are able to make a small tactical "jump" into a nearby system that is not directly connected by the hyperlane network.
- **Gateways** – New megastructures that can be built, or found and reactivated. They function similarly to wormholes in that they initially pair up with a random other Gateway somewhere in the galaxy, but all Gateways of an empire can freely connect to any other they own.
- **Galactic terrain** – Systems can now have environmental effects and hazards that cause profound tactical and strategic effects on ships. For example, pulsar render shields unusable, nebulae block sensors from picking up ships outside the system they are in, etc.
- **Basic ascension perks** – The majority of ascension perks are now included in the base game without the need of DLC to unlock them.
- **War overhaul** – To declare war a casus belli is now required. Different casus belli have different types of wargoals. System are considered occupied if the Starbase and all its planets controlled by the player are under enemy control. Occupying a system awards the owner control of any mining and research stations and the ability to use the Starbase.
- **Claims** – One way to get a casus belli is by having a claim over a system. They require influence and it is possible to claim a system multiple times, for a more ideal peace deal.
- **War exhaustion** – Warscore is gone and has been replaced with war exhaustion that measures the total weariness and attrition suffered by all empires. It goes up from having planets and starbases occupied by the enemy, suffering losses during combat, and passively by attrition. The speed at which War Exhaustion accumulates is influenced by factors such as ethics, traditions, technology and the amount of claims being pressed.
- **Fleet Size Limit** – A new concept called command limit restricts how large an individual fleet can be. There is now a Force Disparity Combat Bonus that's applied when a smaller force is engaged with a larger one in battle. This allows casualties on both sides to be more proportionate. Ships below 50% health now have a chance to disengage from battle depending primarily on the currently selected war doctrine and secondarily on the amount of damage received and ship class. Damaged ships now have their speed and combat ability reduced, all the way down to a ~50% reduction when almost destroyed.
- **Fleet manager** – New interface window that allows players to keep track and manage fleets. Each fleet now has a template that keeps track of how many ships, their sizes and individual designs the fleet is supposed to have. Fleets can now reinforce by use of a button, filling in any ships that are missing or were destroyed based on the current template.
- **Home bases** – Each fleet now has a home base assigned. It is to this base the fleet gets redirected when recalled or looking for repairs.
- **Armor changes** – Each point of armor is now effectively one extra hit point for the ship, forming a new health bar between Hull and Shields that will not repair itself under normal circumstances.
- **Ship designer changes** – All empires now start with all basic weapons types researched. Ships now have a single reactor with a certain power output depending on ship class and technology. Missiles are now exclusive to the torpedo slot and bypass shields entirely. Ship computers can now have four different combat modes: swarm, picket, line, and artillery.
- **Army rework** – New mechanic has been introduced called combat width, it is determined by the size of the world and it dictates how many troops can be engaged at any moment. Defense armies are now created from certain buildings and armies on planets no longer reduce unrest directly. Assault armies are now based in space but can be directed to garrison a planet to help against planetary invasions. There's also collateral damage where civilians and civilian infrastructure can be damaged as fighting goes on. Different troop types cause different amounts of damage. This damage can be reduced by building and manning fortresses with POPs. Retreating regiments now have a significant chance of being destroyed. Army attachments have been entirely cut from the game.
- **Orbital Bombardment changes** – Worlds no longer have fortification levels, instead bombardment now deals planetary damage. Planetary damage can kill armies not protected by a Fortress, ruin buildings, and kill POPs. Armageddon Bombardment can now turn a planet into a depopulated tomb world if given enough time. Worlds cannot be invaded if there is a hostile Starbase in the system.
- **Technology changes** – Technology and unity penalties are now based on the number of owned worlds and systems. Worlds now give less of an impact on tech costs. There are now five tiers of tech as well as a special sixth tier that relates to Fallen Empire technology and is only obtainable via salvaging. More researchable technologies have been added, in general related to weapons and defense.

## Major DLC changes

# Marauder neighbor events

Marauder neighbor events can take place while an empire has a claimed system bordering a Marauder Empire. Each event can only happen once.

### Event: The Great Whetstone

Evt machine space battle

An extended period of unrelenting border skirmishes with the [neighbor marauder empire name] has hardened our serving naval crews. Their abilities have been tempered in battle, and our forces have even adopted several complex [marauder species name] combat maneuvers that will give them an edge in future conflicts.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Marauder Whetstone modifier added for 120 months, giving the following effects: Ship Fire Rate +10%

### Event: Escape Pod

Evt hangar bay

A [marauder species name] escape pod drifted into our space recently, after a particularly violent clash between two warring clans of the [neighbor marauder empire name]. Border patrol units intercepted the pod and opened it, revealing a grateful [marauder species name] flag officer. The Commander has pledged to serve us until death, at no cost.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Welcome aboard, Commander.**
 - Gain a level 4 commander with the Mercenary Warrior trait
- **Option:** **Until death is it. Dispose of the xeno.**
 - Influence Gained: 50
- **Option:** **Euthanize the fleshling.**
 - Influence Gained: 50
- **Option:** **Harvest the creature.**
 - Influence Gained: 50
 - Food Gained: 1
- **Option:** **We have no need of another Commander.**

### Event: Resource Cache

Evt space debris

By chance, patrol units recently discovered a hidden deep space resource cache in the [border system name] system, close to our border with the [neighbor marauder empire name]. The massive cargo containers of the cache contains spoils from several [marauder species name] raids that must have been launched centuries ago. At some point this cache was forgotten, or perhaps its owners were killed in another raid or one of the countless [marauder species name] internecine feuds. In any event, its contents now belong to us.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Excellent.**
 - Energy Credits Gained: 300
 - Minerals Gained: 300

### Event: Abandoned Habitat

Evt space debris

We have discovered the remnants of a half-finished [marauder species name] space habitat in close orbit around [celestial object name], inside our borders. Evidently, at some point the [neighbor marauder empire name] attempted to establish a permanent presence in the [border system name] system, but for whatever reason this endeavour was abandoned. Due to its close proximity to [celestial object], the unfinished habitat eluded detection during our initial survey of the system. It is little more than a dense collection of space junk at this point, but there are a lot of valuable minerals among the wreckage that could be salvaged.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Salvage everything we can use.**
 - Minerals Gained: 400

### Event: Shuttle

Evt machine space battle

A small [marauder species name] shuttle recently crossed into our space in the [border system name] system, pursued by raiders from the [neighbor marauder empire name]. We are not certain why they were being chased by their own people, but the raiders withdrew when they were challenged by our border security. The heavily damaged shuttle was recovered, revealing that the crew had perished shortly after they entered [border system name]. Its cargo hold was filled to the brim with stolen energy credit chips.

**Trigger conditions:** None

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **By right of salvage, the credits are ours.**
 - Energy Credits Gained: 400

### Event: Refugees

Evt colony settlement

Transports carrying a large number of [marauder species name] refugees have crossed into our space from the direction of the [neighbor marauder empire name]. These exiles have apparently been expelled from the decrepit space stations they once called home in some sort of ritual, designed to act as a means of population control in times of limited resources. They have been allowed to settle on [colony name] .

**Trigger conditions:** Refugees Welcome Policy

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **They are welcome there.**
 - 100 Marauder pops with the Extremely Adaptive, Rapid Breeders, Nomadic, Quarrelsome, Deviants and Habitat Preference traits is added to a colony bordering a Marauder Empire

### Event: Drifting Fleet

Evt pirate armada

A small fleet of derelict [marauder species name] warships was recently discovered in the [border system name] system, not far from the territory of the [neighbor marauder empire name]. Computer logs on the ships indicate that their crews fled into our space to escape some kind of clan feud. Unfortunately for them, they brought few supplies and soon starved to death. The ships have been adrift ever since. Our engineers have gone over the ships and they appear to be in decent condition. If they are crewed, we could commission them into service with our own fleet.

**Trigger conditions:** Year is at least 2230

**Mean time to happen:** Time 30 months

- **Option:** **Yes, they could prove an asset.**
 - Gain a fleet of 1 Marauder cruiser, 2 Marauder destroyers and 4 Marauder corvettes
- **Option:** **No, those ships are space junk. Scrap them.**
 - Minerals Gained: 200

### Event: First Contact

Story pack

2023-03-14 / 3.7

Paradox / Steam

**<< Previous DLC** **Next DLC >>**

**First Contact** is the 5th story pack for Stellaris . It was announced on 2023-01-17 and was released on 2023-03-14 alongside patch 3.7.

## DLC features

You are not alone! The galaxy is vast and full of wonders, but it's also full of alien empires you're going to encounter, whether you're ready or not.

First Contact offers a set of new origins and mechanics that give players the chance to tell stories about their civilizations' early encounters with visitors from the stars — ones that may not have come in peace:

Event trigger **New Origins**

- **Broken Shackles** : You didn't take to the stars; you were taken to the stars as an alien captive! Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin… and will your former captors take notice?
- **Payback** : No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own — until they invaded. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you're about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!
- **Fear of the Dark** : As you've explored your home system, you've always suspected you weren't alone in the galaxy… especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an "incident" a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?

Event trigger **New Pre-FTL Interaction Options**

- What will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story?
- New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?

Event trigger **Cloaking Technology**

- Nobody saw this feature coming!
- Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware.
- Keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts.
- Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong... you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!

# Primitive commerce events

Primitive commerce events can take place every 5 years as long as an empire has a Commercial Agreement with a pre-FTL civilization. Once a primitive commerce event takes place the same empire will not receive another primitive commerce event for 15 years. Each event can only happen once. Empires with the Broken Shackles origin cannot get these events from the homeworld of any of their starting species.

### Event: Enslaved

Evt surrender

We have received disturbing reports from the [pre-FTL civilization name] Pre-FTLs: in remote regions of the planet, several spacefaring merchants, mainly smugglers, have disappeared along with their ships. A discreet investigation revealed that they were pressed into work in the mines, far from prying eyes. It is important to note that this was not done by the [pre-FTL civilization name] authorities, but rather a few local warlords and criminals, and that all of the abducted individuals were in violation of the treaties we signed with the Pre-FTLs.

Free from regulation, our merchants are reaping massive profits, but are forbidden of leaving the complex. As a result, smugglers and organized gangs have established a thriving black market economy. So far, the [pre-FTL species adjective] have turned a blind eye, but if things continue, the freeport will inevitably be overrun by criminals.

### Event: Land Grabs

Evt bankruptcy

When the deal was signed, measures were put in place to ensure the sovereignty of the locals, but some of our own people are skirting the law to buy up vast quantities of land through local strawmen. At the current rate, within a generation [pre-FTL world name] will be wholly owned by private traders.

Evt emergency workers

One of the commodities we have been trading with the [pre-FTL civilization name] Pre-FTLs is tasty, but very ordinary food. At least to our species. However, this basic sweetener has proven to be a very powerful psychotrope for the [pre-FTL species name]. It is highly addictive, and extremely dangerous.

Given their rapid breeding, it has become increasingly difficult to contain the invasion. Unfortunately, the species is a symbol of plenty to the people of [pre-FTL world name].
