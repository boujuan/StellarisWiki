# Utility components

Utility components are devices that can be installed on military ships to enhance their defensive capabilities and thus increase their survivability in combat against enemies. They are unlocked by researching or obtaining the technology with the same name.

## Defenses

Small, Medium, and large utility components increase the durability of a ship by providing extra hit points. These come in three forms: shields, armor, and hull.

### Shields

Shields form the first layer of hit points of a ship. They are effective against energy weapons but vulnerable to kinetic weapons and penetrated by guided weapons and strike craft. Shields regenerate but also consume power.

Mechanical ships use the following shield components. They provide more hit points and less regeneration than biological components.

| Component | Small | | | | Medium | | | | Large | | | | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cost | Power Power | Shield Shields | Shield Regen | Cost | Power Power | Shield Shields | Shield Regen | Cost | Power Power | Shield Shields | Shield Regen | | |
| **Deflectors** Energy deflector screens can stop a limited amount of incoming enemy fire before overloading. Their main drawback is that they consume large amounts of power. | 5 | 15 | 75 | 0.5 | 10 | 30 | 190 | 1.2 | 20 | 60 | 450 | 3 | |
| **Improved Deflectors** These updated deflector screens are capable of soaking up even more punishment before they overload. | 7 | 20 | 100 | 0.6 | 13 | 40 | 250 | 1.6 | 26 | 80 | 600 | 4 | |

### Armor

Armor forms the second layer of hit points of a ship. They are effective against kinetic weapons but vulnerable to energy weapons. Compared to shields, armor does not regenerate but has around 33% more hit points when tiers are equal.

Empires that have the Galvanic Synthesis, Galvanic Symbiosis, Galvanic Retrofitting or Biometallic Cartel civic unlock regenerative versions of their standard armor components. They cost Living Metal instead of Alloys, equal to twice their original cost, but their upkeep is still paid in Alloys. These components have the same stats but also provide +2% Energy Weapons Fire Rate and provides regeneration the following way:

- If the ship is mechanical it regenerates 1% of its Hull and Armor daily
- If the ship is biological its existing Armor regeneration is doubled and regenerates up to 100%, rather than only when below 50%.

### Boarding cables

Boarding Cables are a component only available to empires with the Treasure Hunters origin that defeat the second Black Needle fleet. They cost 15 Alloys and need 15 Power Power. Each component has a 5% chance to capture an enemy ship and a 0.5% chance to capture the enemy Commander if the enemy fleet had any. If a Commander is captured its owner will be offered the option to pay Energy that scales with the empire's total Trade Value to receive them back. If the owner refuses the captor empires has the following options:

- All empires can imprison the leader to gain 100 Intel on its empire
- Empires that are not Pacifist or Xenophile can execute the leader to gain 250-1000000 Unity
- Empires that are not Militarist or Xenophobe can keep the leader on the capital to gain 40-100 Influence

The legendary paragon Captain Ness also applies the same effect to the entire fleet.

Titans and colossal ships cannot be captured. Nanite and offspring ships can only be captured if the empire is already capable of building them.
