# Species traits

**Species traits** represent a species' innate functions, abilities, and personality. Though traits are initially decided at a species level, individual pops of the same species can end up with different traits with genetic modification, producing new subspecies. Some traits affect how strongly a pop is attracted to certain factions. Hovering over a species' portrait will list the combined effects of all species traits.

Most traits come in mutually exclusive groups that affect the same aspect of the species, such as Nomadic and Sedentary. These groups include traits with opposite effects, as well as stronger variants of a trait. The Adaptive Evolution situation can gives species traits that are mutually-exclusive however.

## Primary species trait

Every species has a primary species trait which depends on its phenotype. The trait decides what other traits are available, how the pops multiply and what resource will pops of that species consume.

| Trait | Multiplication | Pop upkeep per 100 pops | Effects | Available traits | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Organic** Carbon based lifeforms require a steady diet of nutrients to preserve their biological functions. | - Growth<br>- Organic Assembly | 1 Food | | Biological traits | Changing portrait, adding negative traits, and removing positive traits requires biological ascension |
| **Lithoid** This species has a silicon based biology, and consumes minerals rather than food. They are tougher than traditional organics and have slower metabolisms, making them long lived but slow to reproduce. | - Growth<br>- Organic Assembly | 1 Minerals | - −25% Pop growth speed<br>- −25% Pop assembly speed<br>- +50% Habitability<br>- +50% Army health<br>- +50 Years leader lifespan | Biological traits | Changing portrait, adding negative traits, and removing positive traits requires biological ascension |
| **Thermophile** This species evolved tissues of metallic alloys to grow and thrive on hot planets where traditional organics would cook. These alloyed cells are slower to degrade and are replaced infrequently, delaying the onset of age-related diseases. They also conduct cold temperatures, which can threaten their health in colder climates. | - Growth<br>- Organic Assembly | 0.25 Alloys | - +10 Years leader lifespan<br>- +20% Volcanic World Habitability<br>- +50% Minimum Volcanic World Habitability<br>- −30% Cold Habitability<br>- Cold planets are replaced by Volcanic worlds at homeworld selection | Biological traits | Changing portrait, adding negative traits, and removing positive traits requires biological ascension |
| **Machine** This species is made up of highly advanced machines. | Mechanical Assembly | 1 Energy | - +100% Machine world habitability<br>- +50% Species minimum habitability<br>- −25% Minimum Volcanic World Habitability<br>- 5-10 Starting leader age<br>- +20 years Leader lifespan | Machine traits | Can freely change portrait and traits through machine modification |
| **Mechanical** Mechanical beings are several orders of magnitude more complex than the purpose-built automatons of old, but most possess fairly limited processing capabilities. | Mechanical Assembly | 1 Energy | - +100% Machine world habitability<br>- +50% Species minimum habitability<br>- −25% Minimum Volcanic World Habitability<br>- 1-10 Starting leader age<br>- Not affected by happiness if the Artificial Intelligence policy is set to Outlawed<br>- Cannot generate leaders without the Artificial Personality Matrix technology | Machine traits | Can freely change portrait and traits through machine modification Used by robotic species created by individualist non-machine empires. |
| **Extradimensional** This species originates from another dimension and requires a great deal of energy to survive in our universe. | - Growth<br>- Organic Assembly | 1 Energy | - +50% Habitability<br>- +50% Years leader lifespan<br>- +0.5 Physics research per 100 pops<br>- −25% Pop growth speed<br>- Upkeep +50% Pop upkeep | None | Cannot change portrait or traits Used by the Formless species |

## Pop modification

A species' traits are selected at the start of a new game but those can be changed or improved as new technologies are researched. Both biological and robotic pops can be modified and each has its own set of traits for biological pops or robotic pops . In addition, a small number of events can modify the population of a colony.

### Number of traits

The number of traits that a species can have is limited by two values: trait points and trait picks. Additional trait points and trait picks can be obtained throughout the game from various sources.

- **Trait Points** are spent on positive traits and added by negative traits. Traits that have both positive and negative effects usually do not cost points, nor do certain special traits. The starting number of trait points is **2** for biological species, **1** for Machine species, and **0** for Mechanical species.
- **Trait Picks** is the total number of traits that a species may have. The starting number of Trait Picks is **5** for biological and Machine species and **4** for Mechanical species. Traits which do not cost Trait Points also do not cost Trait Picks.

### Species templates

Population modification is done via **templates** , which creates a subspecies. Templates can be applied to pops per subspecies (including original species), per planet, or per subspecies on a planet. Modified pops are considered part of the same species as the original even if the name and portraits have been changed. They will inherit the same species rights as the original species but those can be then changed to something different for each subspecies.

Templates with zero current pops can be freely modified or deleted . However, templates with at least one pop cannot be changed directly and the template modification window presents only the option to create a new one.

After a template has been applied, a special project to modify the selected pops appears in the situation log. The project is canceled in 30 days if not started. Depending on the type of modification, how severe the modification (total amount of trait point differences), and how many pops were picked, this special project can be very expensive in science. The system is currently designed towards favoring bulk modification of many traits over specific via a high base cost.

The cost to modify a species can be reduced by −50% by the following traditions: Synthetics tradition tree finisher, Advanced Tools, Modular Cybernetics or Allelic Expression. Additionally, the Plentiful Fossils archaeology site can add a permanent −25% modification cost.

A non-default subspecies can also be set in its species rights to passively integrate into the default subspecies over time.

### Auto-modding

Certain traits grant the auto-modding effect, which will cause the trait to copy the bonuses of others traits that will help a pop in its job. The bonuses start at 0% and gradually increase towards 100% each month at a rate that depends on how many pops have to be auto-modded simultaneously. The speed is increased by pop assembly buildings. The effects of auto-modding are not shown in the Species menu but can be seen if a population group is selected and hovering over the auto-modding trait will display all copied effects and their current efficiency. If a game is started with an auto-modding trait, all pops will start fully optimized.

There are six auto-modding traits that will copy the effects of traits that are beneficial to a pop's job. Each trait has its own set of traits it can simulate.

| Trait Job main output | Vocational Genomics | Universal Augmentations | Fleeting Excellence | Adaptive Frames | Adaptive Mutations | Malleable Genes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Amenities | Charismatic | Embellished Augments | Crafted Smiles | Emotion Emulators | Adaptive Harmonics | Malleable Harmonics |
| Energy | Ingenious | Superconductive | Technical Talent | Superconductive | Adaptive Insulators | Malleable Insulators |
| Food | Agrarian | Harvesters | Farm Appendages | Harvesters | Adaptive Plows | Malleable Plows |
| Minerals | Industrious | Power Drills | Dedicated Miner | Power Drills | Adaptive Claws | Malleable Claws |
| Research | Intelligent | Logic Engines | Augmented Intelligence | Logic Engines | Adaptive Cortex | Malleable Cortex |
| Trade | Thrifty | Trading Algorithms | Commercial Genius | Trading Algorithms | Adaptive Pheromones | Malleable Pheromones |
| Unity | Traditional | Loyalty Circuits | Expressed Tradition | Propaganda Machines | Adaptive Sense Organs | Malleable Sense Organs |
| Alloy Consumer Goods | No | No | No | No | Adaptive Calluses | Malleable Calluses |

The Mutagenic Habitability trait auto-mods pops to match the habitability of their current planet.

## Uplifting

For pre-sapient species , the option to create templates is replaced with the option to uplift and bring them to sapience. It requires the Epigenetic Triggers technology and costs 3000 Society research. Upon completion, the empire instantly integrates the uplifted species and gains 50 Influence. In addition, the uplifted species gains +10% Happiness when living within the borders of the empire that uplifted it. The initial ethics of the uplifted species are determined by a series of initial events. Afterwards, the species is fully susceptible to ethics divergence.

Species with the Nascent Stage trait will grow new pops as pre-sapient for the first five years of life. Those pops cannot be manually uplifted or integrated.
