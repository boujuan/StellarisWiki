# Pre-FTL species

There are two types of species that did not achieve FTL in the game: pre-FTL civilizations and pre-sapient species. They can be made plentiful or outright disabled via the galaxy generation options .

**Pre-FTL civilizations** are civilizations that have yet to develop the technology necessary for interstellar space travel. They advance through multiple ages as their history is written and can become full-fledged interstellar empires if they are technologically enlightened by another spacefaring empire or left alone enough to develop on their own. Pre-FTL civilizations have a 3% chance to spawn in each habitable system, modified by the Pre-FTL Civilizations and Pre-Sapient Species game setting.

**Pre-sapient species** are species with intelligence beyond animals but which did not achieve sapience yet. It will take millions of years for them to become sapient, but spacefaring empires can accelerate this process, turning the pre-sapients into productive galactic citizens within the span of just a few decades. Pre-sapient have a 5% chance to spawn on each habitable planet, modified by the Pre-FTL Civilizations and Pre-Sapient Species game setting.

Pre-FTL species with the Thermophile trait can only be found on Volcanic Worlds and Volcanic Worlds can only have species with the Thermophile trait.

## Pre-FTL civilizations

Pre-FTL civilizations exist in various ages of development they slowly go through, visible after an observation post has been constructed. They usually have the Developing Nation origin, but also have a 5% chance to have a regular origin as long as the required DLC is installed

Pre-FTL civilizations can always be invaded and conquered as long as their system is owned by the empire and the Pre-FTL Interference policy is set to Aggressive Interference. Pre-FTL civilizations have no means to resist a technologically superior invader, although Post-Atomic civilizations can be harder to conquer early game. Conquered worlds will get the Pre-FTL species, Stellar Culture Shock modifier for 10 years, which locks out the former primitive pops from using colony ships, being resettled, joining Factions or being released as a Vassal . It also brings −20% Stability, −20% Resources from Jobs, and −50% Empire Size from Pops.

If both First Contact and either Utopia or BioGenesis are installed, every pre-FTL civilization has a 7.5% chance to be a Hive Mind.

A colossus equipped with a Nanobot Diffuser can be used on a primitive world instead of conquest, but will generate a temporary −40 Opinion from every other empire.

| Age | Buildings | Pops | Armies | Government | Awareness chance | | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Increase | Decrease | | | | | | |
| Stone Age | Crude Huts | 400 | No army | Tribal Society | 1% | 90% | This civilization is currently in the equivalent of a Stone Age. They have mastered fire and developed a rudimentary spoken language, but we have yet to see any evidence of metallurgy or written communication. |
| Bronze Age | - Stone Palaces<br>- Primitive Dwellings | 800 | 3 primitive armies | Tribal Society | 1% | 90% | This civilization is currently in the equivalent of a Bronze Age. Primitive metalworking and the first written languages have appeared, while cities and larger communities are taking shape. |
| Iron Age | 900 | 3 primitive armies | Feudal Realms | 1% | 90% | This civilization is currently in the equivalent of an Iron Age. They have spread across most of their homeworld, while iron smelting and forging techniques have enabled them to forge crude but effective tools and weaponry. | |
| Late Medieval Age | - Stone Palaces<br>- Primitive Dwellings<br>- Primitive Dwellings | 1000 | 3 primitive armies | Feudal Realms | 5% | 75% | This civilization is currently experiencing the equivalent of a Late Medieval Age. They have a firm grasp of metallurgy, and the invention of the printing press has started to benefit the spread of knowledge. |
| Renaissance Age | 1200 | 3 primitive armies | Feudal Realms | 5% | 75% | This civilization is currently experiencing the equivalent of a Renaissance Age. Scientific knowledge is increasing at a rapid rate, and the invention of gunpowder has revolutionized warfare. | |
| Steam Age | - Stone Palaces<br>- Urban Dwellings<br>- Primitive Factory<br>- Primitive Mine | 1600 | 3 primitive armies | Feudal Realms | 15% | 50% | This civilization is currently in the equivalent of a Steam Age. The invention of the steam engine has had far-reaching effects on their society and they stand on the cusp of an industrial revolution. |
| Industrial Age | - Regional Capitals<br>- Urban Dwellings<br>- Primitive Factory<br>- Primitive Mine<br>- Primitive Power Plant<br>- Primitive Farms (if No Lithoid) | 2200 | 6 industrial armies | Fragmented Nation States | 15% | 50% | This civilization has advanced into the equivalent of an early Industrial Age. Electricity and internal combustion engines are gradually coming into widespread use, while urbanization increases at a rapid pace. |
| Machine Age | 2400 | 6 industrial armies | Fragmented Nation States | 75% | 25% | This civilization has advanced into the equivalent of a Machine Age, considered a later part of the Industrial Age. Their factories are mass-producing goods and vehicles, and air travel is becoming commonplace. | |
| Atomic Age | 2600 | 6 post-atomic armies | Fragmented Nation States | 75% | 25% | This civilization has advanced into the equivalent of an Atomic Age. They have harnessed the power of the atom, but not yet made it into space. Nuclear weapons may be prolific, and could result in a sudden extinction event. | |
| Early Space Age | 2800 | 6 post-atomic armies | Fragmented Nation States | 75% | 25% | This civilization has entered an Early Space Age. Primitive satellites are orbiting their homeworld, and the first manned space missions have been concluded in low orbit. They will soon be ready to leave their world. | |

### Awareness

Awareness is a measure of how aware a pre-FTL civilization is that alien life exists and goes from 0 to 100. It determines how many years Pre-FTL species#Diplomacy, Stellar Culture Shock lasts if an empire reveals its presence and, if First Contact DLC is installed, whether an Observation Post constructed above the pre-FTL civilization will produce Observation Insights.

| Awareness | Culture shock duration | Observation insights progress | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Completely Unaware** | 50 | Yes | This civilization is not aware of interstellar life. |
| **Low Awareness** | 30 | Yes | Lacking evidence of interstellar life, this civilization still believes it may be alone in the universe. |
| **Partially Aware** | 15 | Yes | This civilization is partially aware of the existence of life in the galaxy. Something is out there, but what? |
| **High Awareness** | 5 | Yes | This civilization is aware that the galaxy is full of life; but who are these creatures, and what do they want? |
| **Fully Aware** | 0 | No | Fully aware of interstellar life, this civilization understands it belongs to a galactic community. |

Awareness has a chance to decrease each year by 1 as long as it is above 10. It also has a chance to increase whenever unnatural things happen in the same star system. The chance for Awareness to increase or decrease depends on the civilization's age.

- +1 each time an uncloaked ship enters the system or decloaks (6 months cooldown)
- +1 each time a starbase or station is constructed
- +2 each time an uncloaked science ship surveys the planet
- +2 each time an uncloaked fleet uses emergency retreat
- +5 each time an asteroid or ship is destroyed or disengaged
- +5 each time a planet is colonized
- +5 each time a megastructure is built or upgraded
- +20 each time a planet is terraformed
- +20 each time a planet is destroyed
- +20 each time a neighbor system is destroyed
- +2 each year as long as an uncloaked Observation Post is present
- +2 each year as long as a planet is colonized

Awareness can also be manually increased or decreased via espionage .

### Age advancement

Pre-FTL civilizations will advance through ages as their history is written. Having an Observation Post built will notify its empire of every age advancement and let it check progress towards the next age by hovering over the age in the diplomacy screen. Depending on the current age and Awareness, it takes the following amount of years to progress to the next age:

| Awareness Age | Unaware | Low | Partial | High | Aware |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stone Age - Late Medieval Age | 320 | 240 | 160 | 120 | 80 |
| Renaissance Age - Machine Age | 160 | 120 | 80 | 60 | 40 |
| Atomic Age - FTL Discovery | 80 | 60 | 40 | 30 | 20 |

After the mid-game year is reached, pre-FTL civilizations will advance twice as fast.

Early Space Age civilizations that don't have an Observation Post built in orbit will eventually develop basic hyperdrives, turning them into a normal empire. If they had the Developing Civilization origin it will be replaced with Prosperous Unification unless they were enlightened. Their starting resources will scale with the game date. If a Starbase was built around the star, the new empire will ask the owner for control of it. Should the request be accepted, they will be granted control of the Starbase and all colonized planets in the system, and gain a temporary +100 Opinion towards the former owner. If the request is refused, the civilization will be annexed. Annexing the civilization costs 200 Influence if Xenophile while granting it control of the system costs 200 Influence if Xenophobe. Genocidal empires only have the option to annex the civilization.

#### Nuclear war

Every 50 years, there is a 30% chance for any pre-FTL civilization that reached at least Atomic Age and does not have the Shattered Ring or Void Dwellers origin to start a nuclear war. The chance is reduced to 15% if the pre-FTL civilization is Pacifist. If an empire has an observation post above their world it will be offered the option to prevent it, which is instant but breaches the Non-Interference Act resolution if it has been passed. If the empire refuses or no empire has an observation post the following will happen:

- 80% chance planet becomes a Tomb World with the Metal Boneyards planetary feature and the pre-FTL civilization reverts to Stone Age, its origin becomes Post-Apocalyptic and all Awareness is removed. Only 200 Pops will survive. Chance is reduced to 66% if the pre-FTL civilization is Militarist.
- 10% chance the planet becomes a Toxic World with a deposit of 3 Society and the pre-FTL civilization is destroyed. Chance is increased to 16.5% if the pre-FTL civilization is Militarist. If the Toxoids DLC is installed, the planet will gain the Toxic Terraforming Candidate modifier.
- 10% chance the planet becomes a Tomb World with the Metal Boneyards planetary feature and the pre-FTL civilization is destroyed. Chance is increased to 16.5% if the pre-FTL civilization is Militarist.

#### Artificial intelligence creation

When a pre-FTL civilization discovers hyperdrives, there is a 20% chance for a machine uprising to take place. If an an observation post is in orbit its owner will be informed. Should a machine uprising take place there is a 50% chance for it to win, which will replace the civilization with a Machine Intelligence empire instead. This cannot happen if the civilization has the Mechanist, Shattered Ring or Void Dwellers origin. In addition to regular options, an empire owning the system can pay 200-300 Influence to subjugate the machine empire unless it has the Driven Assimilator or Determined Exterminator civic.

### Asteroids

Occasionally, an asteroid might be on a collision course with a planet inhabited by a pre-FTL civilization. Destroying the asteroid will grant 150 to 2000 Minerals and add 5 Awareness to the pre-FTL civilization. If the Non-interference Act resolution has been passed, the empire will be in breach of galactic law for 10 years. If the asteroid isn't destroyed before it hits the planet, one of the following will happen:

- 74% chance the pre-FTL civilization regresses one age and only Only 200 Pops survive while the world gets an Impact Crater planetary feature.
- 24% chance the Observation Post is destroyed and the pre-FTL civilization gains 5 Awareness. The chance is reduced to 2.4% if the empire is Xenophobe. If the Non-interference Act resolution has been passed, the empire will be in breach of galactic law for 10 years.
- 2% chance the pre-FTL civilization gains 10 Awareness and progresses through the ages faster. This can only happen if the pre-FTL civilization reached Atomic Age or Early Space Age.

### Observation posts

Observation Posts are stations that can be constructed above the homeworld of a pre-FTL civilization. Having an Observation Post enables diplomacy and espionage of the pre-FTL civilization and will notify the empire of any age advancements.

If the civilization is not aware of aliens, the Observation Post will be able to conduct Passive or Aggressive observation and produce resources that scale with the Infiltration level on the pre-FTL civilization. Both types of observation can trigger various events. If First Contact DLC is installed and at least one Observation Post is built over the homeworld of a pre-FTL civilization that isn't aware of aliens, the empire will gain the Observation Insights situation.

Any Observation Post will slowly increase the Awareness of the pre-FTL civilization. Observation Posts can cloak if the required technology has been researched, canceling this effect.

| Observation | Base effects | Resolution bonus effects | | | Pre-FTL Interference policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Advanced Xenostudies | Underdeveloped System Utilization | Exploitation Act | | | |
| **Passive Observation** | - +8 Society research<br>- Feature +0.5 Observation Insights Progress | +4 Society research | +2 Consumer goods | - +4 Engineering research<br>- +4 Physics research | - No Aggressive Interference |
| **Aggressive Observation** | - +10 Society research<br>- Feature +1 Observation Insights Progress | +6 Society research | +8 Consumer goods | - +6 Engineering research<br>- +6 Physics research | - No Non-Interference<br>- No Subtle Interference |

#### Diplomacy

Aside from improving and harming relations, regular diplomacy actions and agreements are not available with pre-FTL civilizations. However, there is a small number of agreements available only towards pre-FTL civilizations:

- **Reveal Our Presence** is the only option if the pre-FTL civilization hasn't been made aware of alien life. It will make the civilization fully aware and enable diplomacy but will also cause Pre-FTL species#Diplomacy, Stellar Culture Shock for a number of years.
- **Offer Societal Guidance** costs 0.1 Influence and 5 Unity each month and will slowly shift the pre-FTL civilization's ethics to match the empire's.
- **Provide Technology** costs 0.1 Influence and 5 Research each month and causes the pre-FTL civilization to advance through the ages 3 times faster, or 4.5 times faster if the Equal Standing Act resolution has been passed. This option is only available if the Pre-FTL Enlightenment policy is set to Allowed. If the agreement is active when the pre-FTL civilization discovers FTL, it will become a subject of the empire owning the Observation Post, gain a temporary +100 Opinion with it, and the owner's Xenoist faction will be pleased for 20 years.
- **Form Commercial Agreement** costs 0.1 Influence and 5 Minerals each month and produces 0.5 to 4.5 trade value depending on the pre-FTL civilization's age. If the Equal Standing Act resolution has been passed and the planet contains planetary features that produce advanced resources, those will be obtained as well. The agreement also enables empires with Corporate authority to open branch offices on the pre-FTL civilization's planet if the civilization reached Atomic Age or Early Space Age. This option is only available if the First Contact DLC is installed.

### Fear of the Dark civilization

All empires with the Fear of the Dark origin will start with a pre-FTL civilization of the same species in their home system. The civilization will never discover FTL, diplomatic actions with it are not possible and the origin empire cannot construct an observation post or invade them regardless of policies. If the civilization is invaded by an empire of a different founder species, it will destroy itself and turn the planet into a Tomb World. While the civilization exists, the origin empire will have the following interactions with it:

- Each year, there is 4% a chance to receive a leader with the Cunning trait. After 4-6 years, the empire will gain the choice to either return the leader or keep it at the cost of 500 Unity and the leader gaining the Stubbornness trait. If the leader is kept, after another 4-6 years the empire will gain the choice to either return the leader or keep it at the cost of 1000 Unity and the leader gaining the Substance Abuser or Arrested Development trait. If the leader is kept again, in 2.5 years they will be gone and the empire will lose 2000 Unity.
- Each year, there is 4% a chance to receive the option to gain a random technology in exchange for either 5-50 Influence or −50% Survey Speed for 10 years.
- Each year, there is a 4% chance to be offered to pay a random resource and gain +10% Trade Value for 10 years.
- The first time a first contact with another empire is completed, Opinion will be reduced by −200 and there will be an option to start a Total War and receive 5 corvettes cloaked in the enemy capital system.
- If the empire declares war upon another empire or another empire declares Total War upon the origin empire, it will receive a choice between gaining a bonus modifier, 30 Intel on the enemy empire or scaled Unity.
- If an endgame crisis takes place while the civilization exists, the empire will receive +15% Ship Build Speed for 5 years.
- Conducting diplomacy with other empires has penalties:
 - −50-200 Opinion with the signing empire the first time a Migration Treaty is formed
 - −15% Research Speed for 10 years for the first time a Federation is formed
 - −15% Research Speed for 10 years for the first time a subject is gained
 - −5% Happiness for 5 years for the first time becoming a subject
 - −10 Stability for 5 years for the first time a guardian is encountered

If the origin empire completes an ascension tradition tree while the civilization exists, the empire will receive the following penalties for 10 years:

- −10% Research Speed
- −10% Monthly Unity
- −1 Codebreaking

During mid-game, the pre-FTL civilization may join the origin empire depending on choices made in the The Fear of the Dark event chain.

## Pre-sapient species

As opposed to primitives, planets of pre-sapient species can be colonized. The pre-sapient pops do not require either Housing or Amenities. The Pre-Sapients policy determines their status, and if set to Protected, enables the construction of Alien Zoo buildings on worlds that contain pre-sapient pops if the owner is not Gestalt Consciousness. Unlike sapient species, pre-sapients can be purged without diplomatic repercussions.

Terraforming a planet will cause the death of any pre-sapient pops on the planet. Unlike pre-FTL civilizations, pre-sapients will never advance to sapients on their own in-game.

Pre-sapient pops may also be created through the following methods:

- An empire with a Genesis Guides civic colonizes a world or uses the Build Genesis Preserve decision.
- If Utopia DLC is enabled, an empire that forms a covenant with the Composer of Strands (a patron of The Shroud ) has a 25% chance of having 800 Pops in its empire (of any species) degrade into pre-sapients every 15 years.
- If Ancient Relics and Apocalypse DLC are enabled, an empire may use a Colossus equipped with the Devolving Beam colossus weapon to devolve a planet's pops into pre-sapients.

### Policies

The Pre-Sapients policy determines whether an empire tolerates pre-sapients living on their worlds or not. It is unlocked when a world within the empire's borders has a pre-sapient pop on it, or the empire's science ship discovers pre-sapients by surveying or via an anomaly. This policy does not affect pops with the Nascent Stage trait.

| Type | Pre-sapient pops | Planets with pre-sapient pops | Faction approval | | Requirements | AI weight | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Protected** | No Cannot be purged | - No Cannot be terraformed<br>- Can construct Alien Zoos | | No | - Forced if Genesis Guides | - ×0 if does not value others | Though still only simple animals, these beings are no less than what we ourselves once were. They should be allowed the chance at a future. |
| **Tolerated** | Yes Can be purged | Yes Can be terraformed | | No | | | Intelligent animals are still just animals. They can be safely ignored. |
| **Hunted** | Hunted for food, slowly depleting them | Yes Can be terraformed | Xenoist: −10 | | - Utopia DLC<br>- No Xenophile<br>- No Robotic founder species | - ×0 if not Devouring Swarm | An animal without sapience can hardly be considered to be part of our empire, but perhaps they can help our growth in other ways... |
| **Extermination** | Purged automatically | Yes Can be terraformed | Xenoist: −10 | Yes | - No Xenophile<br>- Forced if either:<br>  - Fanatic Purifiers<br>  - Determined Exterminator | - ×0 if neither:<br>  - Fanatic Purifiers<br>  - Determined Exterminator | All rights spring from the capacity for reason. An animal is just an animal, and an animal that stands in our way is just a pest. |

### Uplifting

For pre-sapient species, the option to create templates is replaced with the option to Uplift them. The planet must be colonized and within the player empire's borders. Uplifting a species requires the Epigenetic Triggers technology and costs 3000 Society Research. Uplifted species become part of the empire that uplifted them and get a +10% happiness bonus when inhabiting that empire's planets due to getting the Uplifted trait. Finishing an uplift also grants 50 influence and the Clever Girl achievement.

When an uplift is complete, the pre-sapient species receive the default species rights according to the host empire, even if it is displacement from their own home. Most uplift processes tend to be rocky ( 70% chance of −5% planet mineral output).

If a Hive Mind empire uplifts a species, the species gains the Hive-Minded trait.
