# Hive mind civics

Hive Mind civics represent various characteristics of the collective consciousness of an empire. They can only be picked by an empire with Hive Mind or Mutualistic Intelligence authority. Each empire starts with up to two civics, and this limit is increased to three civics by researching the Galactic Administration technology. Civics can be changed every 20 years by reforming the government spending 10 unity per empire size. Each civic increases the experience gained by a specific Node by +25% . If a civic selected at empire creation unlocks or replaces a building, that building will be added to the homeworld.

Knowing another empire's civics requires Medium Intel on Government. Genocidal civics are always revealed.

If the Shadows of the Shroud DLC is enabled, most civics also give +60 Attunement with a certain Shroud patron.
