# Buildings


**Buildings** are the third level of world development, requiring both districts and specializations to be constructed. Buildings may be ruined by orbital bombardment or collateral damage . Buildings that are ruined can be repaired for half of their cost and construction time.


## Building sets


Each building belongs to one or more building sets . A building can only be built in a district that permits one of its building sets and does not exclude any of them, which depends on its specialization . Changing the specialization of a district may change what buildings are supported and the new specialization's tooltip will display which existing buildings will be retained and which ones will be removed.

- The five general building slots available on all planets, as well as the Urban Expansion specialization, can accept most building sets. The main exceptions are extraction buildings, which can only be built in relevant extraction districts.
- Most specializations can accept an automation building, which produces extra workforce. There are several types with different building sets, each of which has a planet limit of 1. They affect all jobs of types created by the district and its buildings, even if created by other districts or their buildings.
- The Civilian Industry specialization can accept buildings relevant to production of consumer goods, as well as rare resource refineries. Similarly the Heavy Industry specialization can accept buildings relevant to production of alloys. Mixed Industry can accept both.
- Research specializations can accept research buildings relevant to their specialization (all of them if it is a generic Research Enclave). Archives can accept both research and unity buildings, whereas Administrative Hubs can only accept unity buildings.
- Resource districts can accept relevant resource buildings, including output boosters such as the Energy Grid. Notably, Bio-Reactors are considered agriculture buildings, since they alter Farmer jobs to produce energy. Some specializations can accept others, for example Mineral Research Support (mining district specialization) can also accept an Applied Mechanics Institute.
 - Agrarian Idyll empires can build Agrarian Villages specializations which can accept any "urban" buildings, including energy and mineral extraction.


## Capital buildings


Main article: Planet capital


The capital always occupies the first building slot and provides some of the basic housing, amenities, defense armies, jobs that reduce crime, as well as other jobs which vary depending on empire authority and civics. Upgrading the capital is one of the ways of unlocking additional building slots. Capital buildings cannot be demolished, downgraded, disabled, or ruined by orbital bombardment or collateral damage, and are automatically converted to the appropriate type if the planet is traded, ceded, or conquered by another empire with a different authority or if the planet designation is changed.


## Unique buildings


Main article: Unique buildings


Unique buildings are buildings that can only be built a limited number of times per planet or empire, and typically provide effects beyond the creation of jobs. Many of them require the capital to have reached a certain level.


## Housing buildings


Housing buildings come in two levels and increase Housing and Amenities. They are converted if the world is conquered by an empire that uses a different building line.

## Experimentation buildings


Experimentation buildings can only be constructed by empires with the Experimental Sentencing, Judicial R&D or Corrective Consciousness civic. They can only be constructed in specializations that allow research buildings and are destroyed if an empire without any of the civics conquers the world.

## Automation buildings


Automation buildings automate workforce for the districts and buildings within the same district, freeing pops for other important jobs. The amount of automation buildings are limited to one per district, with a maximum of four per planet: one in the central district, and one per specialized district (energy, mining, agriculture). Both central district specialization slots count as part of the central district.


Output is affected by most modifiers, like some edicts and support districts, and upkeep increases with the amount of districts they generate workforce for.


| Tier | Building | Effects | Upkeep | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | **Automation Building** A plaque on the wall reads: 'it automates.' | - +25% Automated Workforce | - −8 per District if basic resource<br>- −10 per District otherwise | - Time 360<br>- 600 |
| II | **Optimization building** Those who have been there say, 'It optimizes.' | - +50% Automated Workforce | - −10 per District if basic resource<br>- −12 per District otherwise | - Time 480<br>- 600 |


## Fallen empire buildings


Fallen empire buildings are efficient buildings that are cheap to upgrade and do not increase in upkeep at higher tiers. They are not converted if the world is conquered by an empire lacking the technology to build them and can also be repaired if ruined.


There are four ways an empire can get access to fallen empire building technologies:

- If Apocalypse is enabled, empires with the Enigmatic Engineering ascension perk can draw the technologies as research options.
- If Ancient Relics is enabled, using the Reverse-Engineer Arcane Technology artifact action has a 20% chance (40% with the Archaeo-Engineers ascension perk) to grant the ability to build a random fallen empire building once.
- If The Machine Age is enabled, empires with the Cosmogenesis ascension perk who have reached the required crisis level can draw the technologies as research options.
- If BioGenesis is enabled, one of the tasks assigned by the Shattered Fragment fallen empires can have a random fallen empire technology as a reward.


Empires with the Wilderness origin must additionally pay 400 Biomass to build or upgrade all fallen empire buildings.

## Pre-FTL buildings


Pre-FTL buildings can be found on planets owned by pre-FTL civilizations. They have negligible output and no upkeep and are removed or converted if the civilization is conquered or discovers FTL.


| Building | Produces | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **Primitive Dwellings** These small buildings provide a minimal amount of shelter, but they keep out the worst of the elements. | +600 Housing | - Bronze Age – Renaissance Age<br>- No Hive Mind |
| **Early Colony** Starting to optimize the space available, these hexagon shaped buildings can house what could moderately be called a colony. | +600 Housing | - Bronze Age – Renaissance Age<br>- Hive Mind |
