# Subject empire

Overlord redirects here. For the game expansion, see Overlord (DLC) .

A **subject** is an empire that has limited autonomy and is subservient to another, usually stronger empire, called the overlord. Their fleets tend to follow their overlord's as long as the overlord has at least one fleet set to encourage taking point. In the default galaxy map mode, subjects have the same color as their overlord.

An empire can become a subject willingly via diplomacy ; the acceptance depends on a number of factors, particularly relative power. Having an overall superior or overwhelming relative power instead enables an empire to use the Subjugation casus belli to forcefully make another empire a subject. Subjects can also be created from sectors that contain individualist pops, or if the empire has the Progenitor Hive origin. The newly released empire will inherit all characteristics of the overlord except sovereign civics and crisis ascension perks. Genocidal cannot release sectors as subjects.

Subjects, except Satrapies, receive a −50% penalty to their diplomatic weight. In addition, operation difficulty is reduced between subjects and their overlord.

Difficulty bonuses to AI empires apply one difficulty level lower to player subject empires. For example, if game difficulty is set to Commodore, the player's subjects will receive the difficulty bonuses for Captain.

## Loyalty

Subjects have a secondary opinion type towards their overlord called Loyalty that ranges from −100 to 100 . Subjects with negative loyalty have the Disloyal attitude, which prevents any diplomatic agreements; subjects with positive loyalty have the Loyal attitude, which increases acceptance of diplomatic agreements. Loyalty can also be used as part of trade deals between the overlord and the subject. Sectors released as subjects start with 50 loyalty.

Loyalty is gained or lost monthly based on subject's opinion and terms of agreements; ethics compatibility, relative power, and overlord holdings have a lesser impact as well. A Pledge of Loyalty can also be negotiated via trade, adding +1.5 monthly loyalty for the duration of the trade deal; if the subject's opinion of the overlord is at least 150 , the Pledge of Loyalty adds +2.5 monthly loyalty instead.

An overlord that has multiple subjects suffers a Divided Patronage penalty resulting in each subject losing −2 monthly loyalty per additional subject. The Feudal Society civic, Franchising civic, Shared Destiny ascension perk and Herald of the Empire trait each add +1 subject exempt from Divided Patronage which effectively treats the overlord as having one less subject for the purposes of Divided Patronage. For example an overlord that has four subjects and the Feudal Society civic would result in each subject losing −4 monthly loyalty from Divided Patronage.

Winning a war with the Subjugation casus belli grants the newly established subject a Recently Subjugated debuff for five years, curtailing monthly loyalty almost completely.

Loyalty also grants experience to specialized subjects . The Suzerains and Sovereignty resolutions - Intergalactic Directives and Bureaucratic Surveillance increase or reduce monthly loyalty in return for benefits to the subject or overlord respectively. It also affects how likely the subject is to accept or break a Secret Fealty.

## Terms of agreement

All subjects and overlords have an Agreement towards each other, which may include certain obligations for the subject or the overlord. Agreements may only be changed once every five years. Reforming the government to add the Feudal Society or Franchising civics removes incompatible terms from all agreements. Many agreement terms are restricted by subject type, primarily Tributary, or by the Suzerains and Sovereignty resolutions.

The influence cost to propose a change in the terms of agreement by either the overlord or the subject is 50 + 5 for each point of immediate change in loyalty; the total change in loyalty is summed across all terms, so that positive and negative changes can cancel out their costs. Once the new terms of agreement are sent the other empire must pay the same amount of influence within three months if they want to refuse.

The initial terms of agreement for subjects created by the Subjugation and Imposed Inclusion casus belli as well as their starting Loyalty are determined by the overlord's Subjugation War Terms policy.

Restrictions from Galactic Community resolutions only apply if both subject and overlord are members of the Galactic Community.

### Contribution

Contribution terms of agreement dictate whether the subject or the overlord will pay something to the other empire. They are adjustable in increments of 15% as a proportion of the subject's income. A negative value means that the overlord pays the subject (a subsidy) and a positive value means that the subject pays the overlord (a tax). Any contribution other than 0% blocks regular diplomatic trading of those resources.

Positive contribution values indicate taxes paid by the subject to the overlord. Negative contribution values indicate subsidies paid by the overlord to the subject.

| Contribution | −75% | −60% | −45% | −30% | −15% | 0 0% 0 | +15% | +30% | +45% | +60% | +75% |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Loyalty | +3.7 | +3 | +2.2 | +1.5 | +0.7 | 0 | −0.7 | −1.5 | −2.2 | −3 | −3.7 |

Immediate effect on loyalty depends on economic impact.

| Subject type | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vassal | −45% to +45% | −45% to +45% | −45% to +45% | −45% to +45% |
| Tributary Subsidiary | +30% to +75% | 0% to +75% | 0% to +75% | 0% to +75% |
| Satrapy | +30% to +75% | 0% to +45% | 0% to 0% | 0% to +30% |
| Prospectorium | +30% to +75% | +15% to +75% | −75% to −30% | 0% to +75% |
| Scholarium | −45% to +45% | −45% to +45% | +30% to +75% | −45% to +45% |
| Bulwark | −75% to −30% | −75% to 0% | −45% to +45% | −45% to +45% |
| Protectorate | −75% to +45% | −75% to 0% | −75% to 0% | −75% to 0% |
| Luminarium | −75% to +75% | −75% to +75% | −75% to +75% | −75% to +75% |

The required subsidy for Bulwark or Prospectorium subjects ( Basic and Research respectively) increases by 15% for each tier the subject reaches: 45% at tier 2, 60% at tier 3. Additionally, a Prospectorium that reaches tier 2 or 3 must pay at least a 30% tax of their Strategic resources.

It is noticeable that the AI empires gains a significant buff on resources yield as the Difficulty goes higher, meaning that accepting a relatively weak empire as a subject while maximizing its resources contribution (beware of its loyalty) is a good option. Reversely, submitting to a Overwhelming AI empire (usually as the Bulwark) and maximizing overlord's due contribution allows you to get through the economically tough time despite receiving a diplomatic weight penalty in return.

## Subject types

There are five types of regular subjects, three types of specialized subjects and five types of fallen empire subjects.

### Negotiable subjects

Negotiable subjects may have their terms of agreement negotiated before or after subjugation.

| Type | Subject requirements | Overlord requirements | Effects | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vassal | No Inward Perfection | Yes<br>Either:<br>- Either Within 60% technological difference<br>- Either Imperial Liege<br>- No Corporate<br>- No Inward Perfection<br>- No Awakened Fallen Empire | | A vassal is a subject of another empire, often with little to no self-rule. Having signed a pact with a foreign power, they are often at the whims and mercy of their overlord, forced to bend to whatever rules and regulations their liege wishes. For some weakened empires, this is the final stopgap before they are consolidated properly into the fold, as they are signing away their autonomy bit by bit. |
| Tributary | | Within 60% technological difference<br>- No Corporate<br>- No Awakened Fallen Empire | | A tributary is a fairly autonomous subject, still in charge of their own affairs both internally and politically. They pay a considerable amount of tribute for their overlord's protection, and as long as the money is flowing, they are mostly free to do whatever they want. |
| Subsidiary | | Within 60% technological difference<br>- Corporate | | A subsidiary is a subject with a considerable amount of self-rule, free to attend to their own affairs. They have signed away some of their independence for a deal where both sides are expected to support and aid one another. |
| Protectorate | Not declared the crisis<br>- Not converting to specialist subject | Standard Empire<br>- More than 50% technological difference<br>- No Imperial Liege | +0.25<br>Monthly influence for overlord<br>- −80% Research cost for subject<br>- No Subject cannot form research agreements | A protectorate is a subject that is considerably weaker than their overlord, reduced to the point where their vassalage is considered a boon to them. Protected from the dangers of the greater galaxy, they can stabilize and improve their homeland as their liege looks out for them. |
| Satrapy | | Khan's Throne relic | Subject contributes 30% of their naval capacity to the overlord | A Satrapy is a Subject type continuing the traditions of the Great Khan that is obligated to provide their Overlord with both ships and resources. |

#### Specialized subjects

Specialized subjects cannot be integrated and have additional effects. They can gain experience to increase in tier and gain additional effects. To reach tier 2, they need 1200 experience, and to reach tier 3, they need 3600 experience. Experience is gained monthly at a value of a tenth of the subject's loyalty. Empires with the Imperial Fiefdom origin will become a specialized subject of their choice shortly after the game starts. Protectorates cannot be made into a specialized subject unless they have the Enlightened origin; any other regular type of subject can be turned into a specialized subject through the agreement screen.

Overlord effects do not stack if there are multiple specialized subjects of the same type. The Relay Network effects require a Hyper Relay connection between the overlord and subject's capital systems and only apply to overlord systems connected to the same Hyper Relay network.

Each specialized subject type has a preferred ethic. Conversion to the specialized subject will be twice faster if the subject has the ethic and twice slower if the subject has the opposite ethic.

### Fallen empire subjects

Fallen empire subjects have preset terms of agreement. They do not allow subject integration or holdings.

| Type | Proposing empire | Diplomatic Freedom | Expansion | Overlord Conflicts | Subject Conflicts | Resource Contribution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dominion | Doctrinal Enforcers | Independent Diplomacy | Expansion Permitted | None | None | Basic 30% |
| Satellite | Watchful Regulators | Independent Diplomacy | Expansion Permitted | None | None | Research 30% |
| Signatory | Benevolent Interventionists | Limited Diplomacy | Expansion Permitted | None | Defensive | None |
| Thrall | Jingoistic Reclaimers | Independent Diplomacy | Expansion Prohibited | None | None | Basic 30% |
| Political Client | Reforged Whip | Limited Diplomacy | Expansion Prohibited | None | None | Basic 30% |
| Scion | Scion origin | Independent Diplomacy | Expansion Permitted | All | None | None |

### Luminarium

Luminarium is a subject type only possible for the Formless . They will automatically be converted into such if they are subjugated at the end of the Crystal Rift event. The Formless gain +100% Jump Drive Range and −90% Jump Drive Cooldown and the overlord gains −50% Physics Research Cost. Aside from Contribution, their terms of agreement cannot be changed, not even if Galactic Community resolutions would prohibit them.

## Integration

Subjects that have Integration Permitted in the terms of agreement can start to be integrated into the overlord empire via a diplomatic action after ten years of being the overlord's subject, transferring ownership of their systems, ships, and relics to the overlord; the subject's leaders, stockpiled resources, and armies are not transferred.

Only one subject per overlord can be integrated at a time. Integration will continue in the event of a Protectorate with Inward Perfection becoming a Tributary or Subsidiary through technological advancement.

Integration costs 5 influence per month and has a base cost with the following formula: Base cost = 50 + number of pops + (10 * number of planets)

If the player empire is integrated, the game is automatically lost.
