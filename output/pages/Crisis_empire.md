# Crisis empire

This article is about regular empires pursuing a crisis path. For the midgame and endgame crisis events and factions, see Crisis .

Regular empires can become a crisis by taking a crisis ascension perk . All crisis ascension perks will unlock the Crisis tab, where the crisis progression comes in 5 levels and grants various perks. The last level can only be unlocked by independent empires. An empire becoming a crisis will not stop endgame crises from occurring.

Opinion penalties only apply from empires that have at least Medium Intel on government unless the player crisis reached the final level.

## Galactic Nemesis

Empires that pick the Galactic Nemesis ascension perk will be able to acquire Menace and complete expensive crisis Special Projects to progress through the crisis levels. It should be noted that only upon reaching the fifth crisis level is the empire treated as any other crisis (Total War with every other empire). This means that through levels 1–4, the "crisis" empire acts as normal, save for not being able to become the Custodian. Only level 5 crisis is the "point of no return", gated by the Special Project to level up, so to speak. This gives the ascension perk far more value for empires who don't want to take the final step, with its various bonuses.

An AI empire that became a Galactic Nemesis will have their personality set to Crisis Aspirant .

Menace is gained by completing crisis objectives. The amount granted by each objective is reduced if the galaxy is larger or more populated with empires.

| Objective | Menace | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Destroy Enemy Ships** | 15 / galaxy size | Destructive battle is a proven and efficient way to wreak havoc and upset balance. |
| **Destroy Starbases** | 15 / galaxy size | Starbases are the anchor points of empires. Unmoor them, and the empires are doomed to lose control. |
| **Purge or Assimilate Pops** | 15 per 100 pops / galaxy size | An enemy is only a threat as long as it is alive – or an enemy. |
| **Perform Disruptive Operations** | 50 - (2.5 × number of empires) | Hurting our enemies from the inside has proven to be an excellent complement to traditional force projection. |
| **Destroy Empires** | 500 - (25 × number of empires) | Few things disrupt the galactic balance as much as the annihilation of entire civilizations. |
| **Vassalize Empires** | 500 - (25 × number of empires) | As long as they contribute rather than thwart, there is room for subjects in our dominion. |
| **Destroy Worlds** | 500 / galaxy size / habitable worlds | Take Scorched Earth tactics to a whole other level. |
| **Conquer Worlds** | 750 / galaxy size / habitable worlds | Crushing the enemy’s morale can be more efficient than crushing them outright. |
| **Retain Vassals (yearly)** | 50 - (2.5 × number of empires) | Their obedience stands as testament to our flawless dominion. |
| **Be In Breach of Galactic Community Law (yearly)** | 250 - (18 × number of empires) | The audacity of that pathetic bunch of feeble bureaucrats – we will not submit! |

Once enough Menace and special projects are completed, the empire will gain a new crisis level.

| Crisis level | Required Menace | Crisis perk | Effects | Opinion | Special project cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Concern | | Undertaker | - Purge policy is allowed regardless of ethics<br>- +500% Pop purge speed | | |
| Intimidation | - +25% Subjugation acceptance<br>- Can always propose Subjugation | | | | |
| Menace Objectives | - Unlocks the Imposed Inclusion casus belli<br>- Unlocks the Existential Expulsion casus belli | | | | |
| Risk | 1000 | Menacing Corvette | Yes Can construct Menacing Corvette ships | −60 | 3000 Society |
| Base Breaker | +30% Damage against starbases | | | | |
| Relentless Aggression | −75% War exhaustion gain | | | | |
| Danger | 2000 | Menacing Destroyer | Yes Can construct Menacing Destroyer ships | −140 | 6000 Physics |
| Death From Above | - Armageddon Bombardment policy is allowed regardless of ethics<br>- +20% Orbital bombardment damage | | | | |
| Easily Replaced | +50% Ship build speed | | | | |
| Misconfigured Thrusters | - +15% Menacing Corvette evasion<br>- +50% Menacing Corvette disengagement chance | | | | |
| Calamity | 5000 | Menacing Cruiser | Yes Can construct Menacing Cruiser ships | −240 | 12000 Society |
| Targeted Severing | +50% Ship weapons damage | | | | |
| Flyswatter | +30% Menacing Destroyer tracking | | | | |
| Existential Threat | 10000 | Star-Eater | - Yes Can construct Star-Eater ships<br>- Yes Gain two Star-Eaters<br>- Gain Dark Matter Power Technology | −400 | 20000 Engineering |
| Paid in Ambition | −30% Ship upkeep | | | | |
| Harsh Priorities | +30% Menacing Cruiser hull points | | | | |
| Aetherophasic Engine | - +200000 Max dark matter storage<br>- Empire leaves any Federation and Defensive Pact<br>- Empire leaves the Galactic Community or Galactic Imperium if part of it<br>- Unknown Aetherophasic Engine Frame megastructure appears in the capital system<br>- If Galactic Community or Galactic Imperium exists a Declare Crisis resolution is instantly passed against the empire | | | | |

Upon reaching Existential Threat level, the empire will gain control of the Aetherophasic Engine . Should it be fully upgraded, the entire galaxy will be destroyed and the Galactic Nemesis will be declared winner of the game. They will also be awarded the Big Red Button achievement.

## Cosmogenesis

Empires that pick the Cosmogenesis ascension perk will be able to acquire Advanced Logic and research expensive technologies to progress through the crisis levels. Compared to a Galactic Nemesis empire, the character of a Cosmogenesis empire is more dangerously reckless than malicious, and the end goal is not the destruction of the galaxy, though the empire's experiments in tampering with the fabric of reality have far-reaching and often destructive consequences. Unlike Galactic Nemesis, reaching Existential Threat level does not lead to automatic Total War with the galaxy and it has smaller Opinion penalties in comparison, meaning a Cosmogenesis faction can potentially remain at peace with the rest of the galaxy provided it uses diplomacy efficiently.

Advanced Logic is gained by completing crisis objectives. The amount granted by each objective scales down with each empire present in the galaxy. Most of the hostility of this crisis is caused by Purging pops via the Synaptic Lathe ; while this can be avoided, it will lead to much slower progression. Because of how Purging mechanics work, it is also possible to bypass the diplomatic penalties entirely by only using Gestalt Consciousness pops in the Lathe.

| Objective | Advanced Logic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Employ Neural Chips (yearly)** | Neural Chip jobs | The scale of our research is such that sacrifices must be made to accommodate it. |
| **Research New Technologies** | 200 − (10 × number of empires) | With every new technology, no matter how small, we gain insights in the inner workings of reality. |
| **Research Applied Infinity Theses** | 10000 − (200 × number of empires) | Large-scape experiments to alter the rules that govern the behavior of reality will yield precious data. |
| **Secure Galactic Community Support (yearly)** | 100 − (2.5 × number of empires) | Convincing the members of the Galactic Community that our research is essential would go a long way toward fulfilling our plans. |
| **Control Science Nexuses (yearly)** | 800 − (50 × number of empires) | Located far from any gravitational anomaly, this state-of-the-art research facility is used to ascertain unspoiled spacetime data. |
| **Retain Scholarium Vassals (yearly)** | 250 − (10 × number of empires) | Research-focused subjects can help us in our quest for absolute knowledge. |

Once enough Advanced Logic is obtained and technologies researched, the empire will gain a new crisis level. Advanced Logic can also be gained by completing the Vultaum precursor chain.

| Crisis level | Required Advanced Logic | Crisis perk | Effects | Opinion | Required technology |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Concern | | Advanced Logic | - +10% Monthly physics research<br>- Gain Exponential Learning Theory as a permanent research option | | |
| Wetware | Gain Scalable Reservoir Computing as a permanent research option | | | | |
| Non-Baryonic Energy | Gain Dark Matter Power as a permanent research option | | | | |

| Risk | 2000 | Gravitational Tools | - +10% Monthly society research<br>- Gain Gravitic Brush technology as a permanent research option | −30 | Exponential Learning Theory |
| Riddle Escort | - Gain Riddle Escort as a permanent research option if empire uses a mechanical shipset<br>- Gain Cipher Mauler as a permanent research option if empire uses a biological shipset<br>- Gain Quandary Weaver as a permanent research option if empire uses a biological shipset | | | | |
| Antibaryonic Advances | - Gain Dark Matter Propulsion as a permanent research option<br>- Gain Enigmatic Decoder as a permanent research option | | | | |
| Advanced Harvesting | - Can draw Class-3 Singularity as a random research option<br>- Can draw Nourishment Complex as a random research option<br>- Can draw Quantum Drilling Plant as a random research option | | | | |
| Danger | 6000 | Eternal Expansion | - +10% Monthly engineering research<br>- Gain Theoretical Infinity Thesis as a permanent research option | −70 | Gravitic Brush |
| Enigma Battlecruiser | - Gain Enigma Battlecruiser as a permanent research option if empire uses a mechanical shipset<br>- Gain Maze Harbinger as a permanent research option if empire uses a biological shipset | | | | |
| Exotic Antibaryons | - Gain Dark Matter Deflectors as a permanent research option<br>- Gain Enigmatic Encoder as a permanent research option | | | | |
| Complex Infrastructures | - Can draw Aspis Bastion as a random research option<br>- Can draw Galactic Commerce Hub as a random research option<br>- Can draw Fractal Administration Processes as a random research option | | | | |
| Calamity | 18000 | Rulebreaker | - +10% Monthly physics research<br>- Gain The Rules of Reality as a permanent research option<br>- Gain Applied Infinity Thesis as a permanent research option | −120 | Theoretical Infinity Thesis |
| Paradox Titan | - Gain Paradox Titan as a permanent research option if empire uses a mechanical shipset<br>- Gain Cryptic Stinger as a permanent research option if empire uses a biological shipset | | | | |
| Armor and Armaments | - Gain Artificial Dragonscales as a permanent research option<br>- Gain Tachyon Lances as a permanent research option | | | | |
| Golden Age | - Can draw Dimensional Replicator as a random research option<br>- Can draw Molecular-Revitalization Institute as a random research option<br>- Can draw Robot Manufacturing Nexus as a random research option<br>- Can draw Virtual Bliss Plaza as a random research option | | | | |

| Memory and Creation | - Can draw Affluence Emporium as a random research option<br>- Can draw Hyper-Forge as a random research option<br>- Can draw Quantum Innovation Nexus as a random research option | | | | |

If the Keepers of Knowledge are present in the galaxy, the first time an empire researches the **Applied Infinity Thesis** technology, the fallen empire will ask them to accept a modifier of −10% Research Speed and −25% Advanced Logic from Jobs for 20 years or lose −75 Opinion with the Keepers of Knowledge. In addition, each time the technology is researched, there is a 1% chance to trigger a Guardians of the Galaxy awakening.

After reaching the final crisis level, the crisis empire must research the extremely expensive Nascent Universes technology and then construct the equally expensive Horizon Needle. The Horizon Needle is a ship but it is constructed like a megastructure. The construction takes 2400 days and is done in orbit of the capital. The ship is very resilient and has a Jump Drive regardless of whether the empire researched it or not, but has no weapons. Once completed, it needs to be ordered to embark the population of every colony, which will decolonize the former colony. Once every colony has been embarked, the Horizon Needle must embark the population of the empire capital. Unlike colonies, the capital will not be decolonized once the population is embarked and will retain 2000 Pops, but the empires cannot colonize new worlds. Finally, the Horizon Needle must either be ordered to dive into a black hole or complete a special project to dive into the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, the latter requiring the Horizon Needle to remain at the capital for a year. Regardless of what option is taken, the game is won upon completion.

There are multiple endings for Cosmogenesis depending on whether the special project was used or which black hole was plunged into.

- Sending the Horizon Needle into any normal black hole not connected to any events leads to the default ending.
- Diving into the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy leads to a separate ending. It is slightly altered if the empire formed a Covenant with a Shroud entity or has the Knights of the Toxic God origin.
- The following black holes have unique endings: Great Wound, Gargantua, Pantagruel , Terminal Egress , the black holes where the Dimensional Horror or The Elder One emerge, the black hole where the Horizon Signal event chain started and the black hole created by The Worm .
- Empires with Obsessional Directive have a different ending regardless of the chosen black hole as long as they never missed their quota and have not gone for the galactic core black hole. This ending awards the A Universe of Paperclips achievement.

### Post-Cosmogenesis galaxy

The Cosmogenesis ending will make the empire unplayable and bring the option to switch to another empire if any exists.

The Cosmogenesis empire will become a Fallen Empire. Its personality will depend on empire ethics. It will retain all subjects and if it is part of a federation, it will remain as a member. If it had a Synaptic Lathe, the megastructure is destroyed. If the empire was a Hive Mind, it will possess unique civics not found in conventional Fallen Empires and its capital will become a Hive World. The new Fallen Empire will resettle all habitable planets and megastructures within its core sector, filling them with Fallen Empire buildings, and have a Citadel in every system; however, all territory outside the core sector will be lost.

The following effect will occur upon a Cosmogenesis victory across the entire galaxy:

- 9% of all systems will be destroyed.
- 50% of all starbases will be destroyed.
- 30% of all fleets will be destroyed.
- 80% of the systems will gain random deposits.

Every surviving non-capital planet will be radically changed in the following way:

- 5% chance the planet becomes a Shattered World.
- 5% chance the planet becomes a Black Hole.
- 20% chance the colony is destroyed and the planet gains +200% Colony Development Speed, Pop Growth Speed and Mechanical Pop Assembly Speed and +75% Planetary Build Speed for 10 years.
- 21% chance the colony gains 85 Devastation, −100% Pop Growth Speed and Mechanical Pop Assembly Speed and −200% Planetary Build Speed for 10 years.
- 21% chance the colony loses 1300 Pops and gains 8 blockers.
- 21% chance the colony loses 2000 Pops and gains 6 blockers.
- 7% chance the colony gains +200% Colony Development Speed, Pop Growth Speed and Mechanical Pop Assembly Speed and +75% Planetary Build Speed for 10 years.

Every empire will gain +20% Pop Amenities Usage, −20% Happiness and −20 Stability for 5 years.

For 30 days, the date will not display properly.

It is possible to release a sector as a subject before completing the exodus, which will allow the player to continue playing as the released empire. The subject empire will keep its planets, pops, and technologies, including the Cosmogenesis technologies.

## Behemoth Fury

Empires that pick the Behemoth Fury ascension perk will be able to acquire Feral Insight. Unlike other crisis paths, Behemoth Fury does not cause Opinion penalties until the final crisis level is reached.

| Objective | Feral Insight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Build Biological Ships** | 50 / number of empires | Having mastered the cultivation of biological ships, we now refine and expand these processes. This ongoing symbiosis yields ever-greater perks, enhancing our fleets and bolstering our dominion over the living cosmos. |
| **Destroy Biological Ships** | 5 x number of empires with a biological shipset | Enemy biological ships interfere with our biological dominance. We must act decisively, destroying them to neutralize their threat to our supremacy. |
| **Kill Space Fauna** | 100 / galaxy size | Hostile Space Fauna threatens our biological dominance. We must act decisively, destroying them to neutralize their threat to our supremacy. |
| **Grow Behemoth Eggs** | 500 - (25 x number of empires) | Growing supersized zygotes is a crucial step in our elevation beyond the trivialities of planet-based life. |
| **Birth Behemoths** | 2000 - (50 x number of empires) | In the vastness of space, colossal lifeforms are taking shape under our watchful guidance. These behemoths, born of our ambition and mastery, will emerge as titanic forces, reshaping the balance of power in our favor. |
| **Behemoth Raging** | 350 - (25 x number of empires) | Unleashed upon the stars, our Behemoths rampage with primal fury, leaving devastation in their wake. Their uncontrolled wrath is a testament to our power, a force of nature that answers only to our will, when we choose to exert it. |
| **Breed Space Fauna** | 50 / number of empires | Having mastered the breeding of Space Fauna, we now refine and expand these processes. This ongoing symbiosis yields ever-greater perks, enhancing our fleets and bolstering our dominion over the living cosmos. |
| **Capture Space Fauna** | 100 / galaxy size | Untamed Space Fauna act as rogue elements, posing a unique challenge. We must act decisively, capturing these entities to exploit their potential in order to ensure our supremacy. |

The first time the empire loses a Behemoth, it will also gain 1500 Feral Insight.

Once enough Feral Insight has been acquired and the required objectives are completed, the empire will gain a new crisis level.

| Crisis level | Required Feral Insight | Crisis perk | Effects | Required objective |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Concern | | Feral Insight | Yes Defeating a Behemoth takes control of it instead of killing it | |
| Cyclopean Hatcheries | Unlocks the Behemoth Egg megastructure | | | |
| Accelerated Field Trials | +1.5 Society research per 100 Farmers | | | |
| Supersized Crops | +100000 Food storage capacity | | | |
| Risk | 2000 | Gargantuan Brood | Yes Can hatch Behemoth Egg megastructures | Build a Behemoth Egg megastructure |
| Better Glandular Stimulation | - Time +30% Monthly Growth Progress<br>- +50 Fleet Command Limit | | | |
| Transversal Enquiries | +15% Society Research Speed | | | |
| Nutrient Overload | - +3 Food per 100 Farmers<br>- +1 Minerals upkeep per 100 Farmers | | | |
| Danger | 6000 | Harder Chitin | - +10% Military Ships Hull<br>- Armor +20% Armor Hardening | Hatch a Behemoth |
| Faster Growth Cycles | - −95% Ship Alloys Cost<br>- +15% Ship Build Speed | | | |
| Bio-Engineering Mastery | +25% Biology Research Speed | | | |
| Calamity | 18000 | Unbridled Growth | Yes Allows Behemoths to grow up | Finish the Brain Link Trials special project ( 12000 Society) |
| Stronger Organisms | +15% Ship Fire Rate | | | |
| Behemoth Mutations | Feature Issues the Behemoth Mutations special project | | | |
| Existential Threat | 45000 | Mind Meld | - Yes The Behemoth that finished the special project grows to Class IV<br>- Yes Behemoths no longer become enraged from lack of feeding or encountering another Behemoth<br>- Empire capital's primary district is changed to Mindlink Metropolis | Finish the The Mind Meld special project ( Time 1 year and requires a Class III Behemoth) |
| Primal Roar | - −1000 Opinion with all empires<br>- Up to 500 pops have a chance to die<br>- Unlocks the Hunger casus belli<br>- Empire leaves any Federation and Defensive Pact<br>- Empire leaves the Galactic Community or Galactic Imperium if part of it<br>- If Galactic Community or Galactic Imperium exists a Declare Crisis resolution is instantly passed against the empire | | | |
| Ever Hungry | - Starts the Growing Pains situation<br>- Unknown Empire gains the Behemoth transference modifier | | | |
| Ravenous Progeny | - Class IV Behemoths can lay eggs<br>- In a month choose what kind of eggs can be laid | | | |

To win the game, the Behemoth Fury empire must finish the Growing Pains situation and then defeat the Elder Voidspawn guardian and any existing Class IV Behemoths controlled by other empires. Should they achieve these objectives, they will win the game at the beginning of the next year, awarded with the King of Monsters achievement. All planets will be depopulated, all starbases and stations will be removed, and a final choice will appear.

- Choosing to leave the galaxy will result in all fleets disappearing.
- Choosing to stay will cause all fleets to follow the Class IV Behemoth, who will become even more powerful and roam the galaxy. The Class IV Behemoth will be hostile towards all empires except former subjects of the crisis empire. If the empire had any Behemoth Egg or Chrysalis, they will hatch in 10 years. Class I and Class II Behemoths will grow in size every 10 years as well.
- If the empire has communicated with the Prethoryn Scourge a third option will be given to confront the Hunters, which will result in all fleets disappearing. Two years later all empires in the galaxy will have the option to issue a special project to find out where the Class IV Behemoth went. The special project costs 600000 Physics and its outcome is purely narrative although empires with the Cosmogenesis ascension perk will gain 1000 Advanced Logic.

### Behemoths

The Behemoth Fury crisis path grants access to Behemoths, which are hatched from Behemoth Egg megastructures. Behemoths come in four classes depending on their size and cannot be merged with fleets.

Behemoths are fed by destroying bioships, space fauna, guardians or other Behemoths or by bombarding planets. Each time a Behemoth gains 1 Growth, the empire will gain 500 Food. Guardians will always give 40 Growth. Once a Behemoth has fed sufficiently, they can be ordered to grow up in any owned system, which will create a Behemoth Chrysalis megastructure.

When a Behemoth bombards a planet, it will slowly gain Growth and spawn hostile armies. If the armies defeat the defenders, all pops are instantly purged and the Behemoth gains 1 Growth for every 100 pops. The world will also gain the Devastated Settlements, Devoured Biosphere and Slumbering Behemoths blockers if it does not have them already.

Devouring a planet with a Class III or IV Behemoth has the same diplomatic penalties as using a World Cracker.

The Class IV Behemoth is grown from a Class III Behemoth that completes the The Mind Meld special project. It has the ability to lay eggs and is upgraded at each stage of the Growing Pains situation. If a Class IV Behemoth is killed, its empire is instantly destroyed.

| Behemoth | Health | Armor | | | | | Components | Growth required |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Class I** | 175000 | 100000 | 60% | **100%** | −50% | −250 | Bio-Hyperlane Field, Bio-Thrusters, Radiolocation, Neural Implants (Swarm), Focused Lightning Emitter, Large UV Beam Projector, Large UV Beam Projector, Bio-Whirlwind Missiles, Bio-Whirlwind Missiles, Bio-Whirlwind Missiles, Bio-Whirlwind Missiles, Barb Batteries, Barb Batteries, Large Draconic Carapace, Large Draconic Carapace, Large Draconic Carapace, Large Draconic Carapace, Large Draconic Carapace, Large Draconic Carapace, Large Draconic Carapace, Large Draconic Carapace, Large Draconic Carapace, Large Draconic Carapace, Large Draconic Carapace | 150 |

If Behemoths are not fed for too long, they will become enraged within 1-3 years. They can also be enraged manually via a fleet action for the cost of 15000 Food and 150 Exotic Gases and a cooldown of 540 days. Enraged Behemoths are hostile towards everyone, attack all ships in the system and then head for the closest colony or Behemoth Egg to destroy. It will then wait. Enraged lasts 180 days out of combat or until the Behemoth is defeated by an empire with the Behemoth Fury ascension perk. Note that having a cloaked science ship in the same system as a Behemoth will prevent it from exiting the rage naturally. This is likely a bug. Destroying an egg gives the Behemoth 50 Growth. Each time an enraged Behemoth enters another empire's borders, it gives a permanent −50 Opinion and each time it attacks one of their colonies or Behemoth Eggs, it gives a permanent −500 Opinion.

If two Behemoths controlled by the same player are in the same system, one of them will become enraged but will not attack the closest colony or Behemoth Egg if it wins.

Empire with the Reanimators or Permanent Employment that kill a Behemoth cannot reanimate it but will gain 10000 Food and a scaled amount of Unity and Society Research. If the empire is also Spiritualist, the Unity reward will be even larger.

## Galactic Hyperthermia

Empires that pick the Galactic Hyperthermia ascension perk will be able to acquire Crystallized Entropy. An AI empire that goes through this crisis path will have their personality shift to Thermarchy .

| Objective | Crystallized Entropy | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Create Volcanic Worlds** | 350 | Spreading planetary volcanism across the galaxy will fuel our Entropy Crystal economy. With the right terraforming techniques, we can trigger sustained volcanic activity wherever we choose. |
| **Create Red Stars** | 30000 / number of systems | By channeling Entropy Crystals, we can swell stars into Red Giants, fueling the rise of our blazing new empire. |
| **Planetary Arson** | 100 | It is time to teach our rivals the true meaning of supremacy, with a firestorm bombardment that will leave their world in ashes. |
| **Disrupt Ships** | 1 | Cold and temperate worlds serve us no purpose. We must reshape them, by melting their surfaces into forms more suited to our needs.(sic) |
| **Own Volcanic Worlds (yearly)** | 15 x number of Volcanic Worlds | Rising system heat fuels increased volcanism, perfect for advancing our fiery mission. We should prioritize colonizing Volcanic Worlds to stay ahead. |
| **Own Red Stars (monthly)** | 1000 / number of systems | We should prioritize settling systems around red stars. Their vast emission surfaces are ideal for harvesting thermal energy. |
| **Own Gravitational Centrifuges (monthly)** | 10 | Gravitational Centrifuges will help us gather more Crystallized Entropy. |

Once enough Crystallized Entropy has been acquired and the required objectives are completed, the empire will gain a new crisis level. Unlike other player crises, unlocking the first level requires completing a special project too and every subsequent level requires the empire to be independent. Empires with the Red Giant origin who finish the Red Giant Expansion situation one way or another will not receive or have to complete the first special project. Conquering a Galactic Crucible from another empire will not make progress towards increasing the crisis level.

After upgrading the Galactic Crucible megastructure to level 2, it will be able to build Conduits, equal to the number of owned systems, as well as replace any lost Conduit. Whether the megastructure will do so as well as how fast depends on its Overclocking mode. Conduits are ships equipped with a Lensed Paralyzer weapon, which prevents any target from moving or attacking for 7 days. In addition, Conduits have the ability to turn non-blackhole stars into Class M stars. The process takes 6 months and afterwards the Conduit will no longer be able to move but can still be disbanded and the Galactic Crucible will replace them. Owned colonies in systems with a Conduit gain +5% Amenities, +5% Resources from Jobs and +20% Unity from Jobs. Conduits will automatically travel to an owned system and transform the star but before the process is complete they can be manually ordered to travel to another system. Stars that are terraformed will have their Energy deposit increased by a random amount but existing Class M stars with a Conduit will not. Conduits will not terraform stars that power a Dyson Swarm, Dyson Sphere or Quantum Catapult.

After upgrading the Galactic Crucible megastructure to level 3, the empire will have to choose between two special projects: Designated Firestorm and Unforeseen Correlation.

- **Designated Firestorm** costs 25000 Engineering Research, allows the Galactic Crucible megastructure to be upgraded to Galactic Crucible Hub and reach the last two crisis levels, and spawns 6 empty systems around the galactic core.
- **Unforeseen Correlation** costs 25000 Physics Research and allows the Galactic Crucible megastructure to be upgraded to Galactic Crucible Institute but prevents reaching the last two crisis levels.

After upgrading the Galactic Crucible megastructure to level 5, a wormhole will appear in the system with the Galactic Crucible that connects to 3 of the 6 systems that were spawned the galactic core. After 4 years, the other 3 systems will be connected to the rest of the galaxy by hyperlanes. The Mobilization situation will also start when the megastructure is fully upgraded. When the Mobilization situation ends, every empire in the galaxy that is not Genocidal or player crisis will receive the option to declare war on the crisis empire. In addition, if the Galactic Community or Galactic Imperium exist, a Declare Crisis resolution is instantly passed against the crisis empire and if the empire was part of the Galactic Community or Galactic Imperium, it will be removed from it. After the Mobilization situation ends, the Galactic Firestorm situation starts for every empire in the galaxy. If more than 3 of the 6 systems around the galactic core have a Conduit present, the situation will make progress at a rate of 3 each month. If less than 3 of the 6 systems around the galactic core have a Conduit present, the situation will lose progress at a rate of 3 each month. The situation will only end if the crisis empire either succeeds or is destroyed.

If the Galactic Firestorm situation progresses completely, the crisis empire will win the game , receive the Crystallized Singularity relic and the Galactic Firestorm achievement, and if its founder species has the Organic trait, it is replaced by Thermophile. Every star in the galaxy except Black Holes will become a Class M Red Giant, every planet that is not an Ecumenopolis will be terraformed into a Volcanic World, every empire that does not have the Galactic Hyperthermia ascension perk or a founder species with the Thermophile trait is destroyed, and every empire with a founder species with the Thermophile trait will receive 350-1000000 Unity. If the Contingency crisis is taking place, it will be destroyed.

Depending on game difficulty, when the Mobilization situation ends, Fallen Empires may declare war on the crisis empire if they exist. This applies regardless of whether the crisis empire is a human player or AI empire. One Fallen Empire will declare war on Captain, 2 on Commodore, 4 on Admiral and all 6 on Grand Admiral. One of them may also awaken. If the Shattered Fragments are present, they will not become involved unless they have awakened.

Empires whose founder species do not have the Thermophile trait will receive a special project 3 months after reaching crisis level 2. The special project costs 2500 Society Research and completing it increases Habitability on Volcanic Worlds by +50% .
