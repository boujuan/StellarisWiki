# Policies

Policies outline the stance of an empire on other empires, treatment of pops, and acceptable behavior. Once altered, a specific policy cannot be changed until 10 years have passed. Some resolutions in the Galactic Community can make certain policies a breach of galactic law. In this case the policy will show a warning sign next to it.

Changing policies is advised as a way to mitigate faction unhappiness in large empires that have a lot of pops of different ethics , besides the possibility of opening up new possible avenues of power.

## Base game policies
