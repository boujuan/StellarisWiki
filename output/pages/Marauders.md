# Marauders

Marauders are nomadic and militaristic FTL societies that have eschewed planetary dwelling in favor of living on ships and stations, subsisting largely on raiding each other and extorting tribute from settled empires. Marauders are always hostile, but will generally not attack empires unless they enter their systems, or they are in the process of raiding them. A Marauder empire can be eradicated by destroying all stations and void dwellings in their home systems, but these are well defended and will take a powerful mid to late-game navy to deal with them. In addition to that, destroying a Marauder Empire has a chance to trigger the rise of the Horde (see below). Each Marauder empire holds 3 systems (a home system and two additional systems), with the home system having very large deposits of Energy or Minerals. The Marauder systems are populated by Void Dwellings, defense platforms, and the Marauders' fleet(s).

## Dormancy

Marauders will spend the majority of each game in a dormant state, unable to expand beyond their starting systems and without any centralized authority beyond a series of barbaric warlords. Each Marauder empire is assigned one of three sets of dialogues, roughly corresponding to Militarist, Xenophobic, and Spiritualist ethics . Militarists care for little other than the personal glory of their warriors, holding little against other species beyond defending their territory. Xenophobes refer to outsiders as "Dwamaks", constantly threatening to kill and eat any who cross them, and punctuate their speech with violent, vulgar screeches. Spiritualists worship a goddess referred to as "She of the Void", whom they believe to be responsible for their migration into space, and consider all other spacefaring species to be unbelievers who must be purged for violating Her domain.

### Raiding

Marauders will occasionally set out to raid settled empires they have established contact with. Before raiding, they will offer said empire a chance to pay them off with a hefty tribute. Targeted empires can choose to pay Minerals, Energy or Food, the value depending on their monthly income.

| Income | Tribute |
|---|---|
| 0-50 | 250 |
| 51-100 | 500 |
| 101-150 | 1000 |
| 151-200 | 1500 |
| 201-250 | 2000 |
| 251+ | 2500 |

If the Marauders are not paid, they will spawn a separate raiding fleet neutral to all but the targeted empire. While the raid is ongoing, they can still be bought off with tribute, but the price is doubled. Once Marauder raiders reach an undefended planet, they will bombard it until it reaches 15 Devastation, at which point the Marauders will steal either resources or up to 4 biological Pops.

Settled empires can also pay the Marauders to conduct a raid on one of their Rivals for 3000 energy credits, both diverting their attention and potentially weakening that rival's military and economy. While raiding on behalf of an empire, Marauders are treated as allied and their systems can be travelled through. This form of raid cannot be bought off and while they will always reveal they were paid to raid, they will never tell by which empire. Marauders can only raid one empire at a time, but multiple Marauder empires can raid the same target. Marauders will never raid Fallen Empires and will always refuse to do so if asked.

Both forms of raiding involve the Marauders sending a fleet to that empire's territory. The Fleet will attack the nearest colonised Planet, destroying all outposts and mining stations along their path. It can and will travel through wormholes if the route is faster. A fleet on Marauding will go into the orbit of the target planet and either steal some resources depending on the amount of tribute demanded or killing up to 4 biological Pops. They will still be hostile on their way back. Fleet strength depends on the number of years passed, and thus facing them can result in a considerable challenge.

Empires can also permanently hire a Marauder Commander for 2000 Energy. Hired leaders are replaced if they die, start at level 3 and have the Mercenary Warrior trait.

Once the mid-game year has been reached, the option to hire mercenary fleets of varying sizes will be unlocked. All players will be informed of this change. The chance for one Marauder empire to have mercenaries is rolled yearly, and 30 for each Empire/80 for nothing. Mercenary fleets cost a large Energy up-front payment, and consist of a fixed-size fleet that cannot be split, merged or disbanded, with a leader that cannot be reassigned. The fleet does not count towards Naval Capacity, but will only serve for a period of 5 years, after which the empire will have to renew their contract by paying the full cost again.

| Years passed | Raiding fleets composition |
|---|---|
| 0-40 | - 6 corvettes<br>- 4 destroyers<br>- 1 cruisers |
| 40-60 | - 12 corvettes<br>- 6 destroyers<br>- 2 cruisers |
| 60-80 | - 18 corvettes<br>- 10 destroyers<br>- 3 cruisers |
| 80+ | - 24 corvettes<br>- 14 destroyers<br>- 4 cruisers |

| Mercenary fleet | Ships | Hire cost |
|---|---|---|
| - 234th Dwamak-Bashers<br>- Armada of the Voidborn<br>- Her Chosen Champions | - 6 cruisers<br>- 8 destroyers<br>- 16 corvettes | 9000 |
| - Unhinged Screamer Flotilla<br>- Star Rider Flotilla<br>- Order of Eternal Night | - 4 cruisers<br>- 6 destroyers<br>- 12 corvettes | 6500 |
| - Frenzied Volunteer Squadron<br>- First Storm Wing<br>- Twilight Congregation | - 2 cruisers<br>- 4 Destroyers<br>- 8 corvettes | 4000 |

If a mercenary fleet is destroyed, it will be rebuilt and available for hire again within a year. If a Marauder Empire is destroyed while an empire is hiring their fleet, all mercenary fleets will cancel their contracts and join together to attack the vanquisher empire within 5 months. Marauder Refugees will also settle on the planets of the closest empire that has the Refugees Welcome policy .

Marauder Empires refuse to interact with Genocidal empires, meaning they cannot make use of their mercenary or raiding services.

## The Horde

After the Mid-Game year starts, one of the Marauder empires might unify under a Great Khan, an expansionist but ultimately benevolent leader. If the game manages to reach the end game year without the event triggering, it can no longer occur after that. It can happen on its own at any point, however there is also a 2% chance for the event to be triggered each time a Void Dwelling is destroyed. Once this happens, the Marauder empire becomes a crisis faction called a Horde (labelled as a "Marauder Khanate") and will begin expanding in all directions, invading the systems of any empire that will not submit to the Khan, including other Marauder empires but excluding Fallen Empires.

At any time, it is possible for an independent empire to submit to the Khan and become a Satrapy. Becoming one will add a Void Dwelling and two marauder fleets to the capital system, remove the empire from any federations they may be a part of, and subjects will become Satrapies as well. AI empires that lose more than two planets to the Horde have a yearly chance to submit, with the chance increasing the more planets are lost.

The Khan can offer unique dialogues depending on what ethic the Marauder empire had before the rise of the Horde, generally renouncing their people's violent past in favor of their own ends. When the Horde forms, all hired marauder fleets and leaders will cancel their contracts and join the Horde.

The main Horde fleet, called "Chosen of the Great Khan", is led by the Great Khan personally. They start as a level 10 commander with the The Great Khan, Master Gunner, Artillerist II, Demolisher II, Gunship Focus II, Wrecker II and Reckless II traits. When the Great Khan's fleet is destroyed for the first time, they will escape the battle, returning within a year with a second fleet inside of a system they own. If the second fleet is destroyed again, the Khan will die, and the empire who dealt the killing blow will earn the Khan's Throne relic and the No Khan Do achievement. If the horde has been completely destroyed before the Khan makes their return, they are presumed dead after some time and will never return.

If the Great Khan is not killed in battle, then after 20 years have passed since the rise of the Horde, The Khan may also die by disease or assassination. If neither of these happens, then the Khan will die a natural death between 15 and 45 years after the Horde was created.

Once the Great Khan dies, the Horde will become unreachable, leaving an automatic message if diplomatic contact is attempted. All of its fleets will retreat back to within the borders of the Horde's territory and stay there. Within a year, if the Horde isn't destroyed, will change into one of the following:

- If the Horde owns no planets, it will turn back into a Marauder Empire. All Satrapies will become independent and the station and fleets in their capital will be dismantled.
- If the Horde owns between 1 and 5 planets, it will turn into a strong regular empire and keep all existing Horde fleets while all its subjects. The empire will also have a unique civic granting +10% Fire Rate. All Satrapies will become independent and the station and fleets in their capital will be dismantled.
- If the Horde owns between 6 and 9 planets, it will split into two regular empires with claims on each other's systems. The empires will also have a unique civic granting +15% Naval Capacity. All Satrapies will become independent and the station and fleets in their capital will be dismantled.
- If the Horde owns at least 10 planets, it will shatter into four regular empires with claims on each other's systems. The empires will also have a unique civic granting +15% Naval Capacity. All Satrapies will become independent and the station and fleets in their capital will be dismantled.
 - Regular empires created from the Horde are Fanatic Militarist and Xenophobe Hegemonic Imperialists that have the Orbital Habitats technology.

- If the Horde owns at least one planet and has at least two Satrapies, then there is a 10% chance it will instead turn into a Fanatic Egalitarian and Xenophile Federation Builders regular empire. The Horde Successor State will then form a Galactic Union federation with every former Satrapy, with the Horde Successor State becoming its first president.

The number of ships the Horde initially has depends on the game difficulty setting. The Horde will also create a new fleet every few years, the size of the fleet depending on the Naval Capacity provided by Satrapies.

If an empire recaptures a colonised system that belonged to another empire, it will get the option to return the system to its original empire for +40 Opinion and a Favor or keep control of it for −20 Opinion.

As with Marauder Empires, the Great Khan has no intention of coexisting with Genocidal empires and will not offer them to become a Satrapy.

Every 2 years, the Horde will rent all available fleets offered by mercenary enclaves. Each patron of a mercenary enclave will be warned about it and be given 60 days to rent its fleets so that the Horde cannot rent them. If the Great Khan dies all mercenary fleets will end their contracts.

## Ships

Both marauders and the horde use the same ship designs. Raiding fleets vary in size based on game year.
